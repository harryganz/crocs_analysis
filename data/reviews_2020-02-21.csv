Crocs,"Classic Clog|Comfortable Slip On Casual Water Shoe, Army Green, 13 M US Women / 11 M US Men",B0014C5RSS,RSCHZYNVJUJPO,"January 30, 2020",2,Not like the old Crocs and that's a shame.,I was happy to see Crocs available again and was looking forward to my new pair.  Unfortunately these shoes are too small and don't have the nice thick sole that was previously available.  The straps were also way too large on these and though I don't normally use the straps it did make me question the overall quality. I ordered my original size (11M) and am not convinced a size up would be better

She has extra wide feet & they are one of the few shoes she actually likes & that fit. Her friends give her grief about them but, since she is a strong individual, she has never let that stop her from doing exactly as she pleases. She also is following in her stepfather's footsteps & going to school to get her RN degree so they are somewhat apropos, all things considered. She wears Birks all summer but, come fall, these are her jam for the rest of the year. For her, comfort beats style so you'll never catch her in a pair of heels like my younger daughter wears constantly. If you're like her, you'll love these shoes. Have a great day!"

Can't go wrong with them.  I have feet that are difficult to fit and need to wear something around the house that has a bit of arch support.  Crocs are the only footwear that fits the bill.  The toe box is ample, the width is just right, the length fits perfectly.  In ""normal"" shoes, I wear a size 10 XXW and these are perfect!"

But we spend the winter on the beach, and I got tired of ruining at least two pairs of white sandals a year by getting them wet when I was totally sure I wouldn't.  So: crocs.  The reviews left me frightened of mis-sizing, so I shot an arrow in the air and ordered an eight, which fits perfectly.  They are comfortable on the beach, comfortable around the house, and comfortable when we go out on errands.  Mine are white, and they have stayed dazzlingly clean looking.  On the downside, they do accumulate debris, and the do look -- stupid.  But noone is asking me to wear them on Madison Avenue, and for a beach community, they are just great."

They are so comfortable to wear, I have owned many pair over the years. Most recently my teenagers have been begging me for a pair. I ordered them each a pair in white.

I ordered my usual size and they came slightly bigger than I was expecting them to, so I threw them in the dryer with a wet towel for about 4min. and they came out perfect!

I use these for rain shoes, gardening and beach shoes. The older ones, from the day I opened them, were sturdy yet felt like walking on clouds. The new ones are made of completely different material. Its plastic, but not much give or flexibility. They do not feel like clouds, but they will serve their waterproof purpose. Sized exactly the same as the old ones. The brown color kind of faded-looking."

However, my dad thinks this shoe is rather fancy and too fashionable for his taste lol. He prefers the simpleness of Crocs Classic Flip-Flop or Classic Slide. Although the color looks a little different compared to the one shown in photo (the one my dad received has a greener tone to it), but it is still acceptable. Crocs shoes are divided into three types: roomy fit, relaxed fit, standard fit. This shoe has a roomy fit and it fits my dad as expected. On top of that, I got it on sale, so yay for me!"

I actually like them alot!,"I have never wanted Crocs, until my foot doctor said some patients like to wear Crocs to help with plantar fasciitis.  So I figured I'd try them.  I actually love them!  I wear them around the house, because with plantar fasciitis you're not supposed to walk bare foot (I cant stand shoes) but these have helped."

We were looking for next size up to replace previous pair for a fast-growing teen. The size W9/M7 is identical to W8/M6, both made in Mexico, with the strap being shorter than before. Inconsistent sizing makes it virtually impossible to buy online. This model is called Classic and is supposed to substitute for Cayman, but the sizing is all wrong. The ones made in China seem to run larger, but you do not know the origin of the pair that will be shipped.The actual Crocs store might be currently the best option for proper sizing, unfortunately. The only reason I am reviewing is to spare the same hassle and disappointment to other customers."

I'm on my feet a lot in my work, and my feet stay comfortable throughout the shift.  I like to wear a gel insole in them for a little extra padding, and that makes them even more comfortable.  The only downside I find with these shoes is that as they age and the little nubs on the bottom wear off they become very slippery on certain surfaces.  Other than that, they're the perfect shoe for someone on their feet a lot."

Buyers beware.  I ordered the same size and style of unisex classic  crocs as my old ones.  They were significantly shorter.  Exchanged to the next size up, and they were identical to the old ones.  I could not have been mistaken because the size was still visible imprinted on the bottom of the old shoes.  I would give them 5 stars because I like crocs, but feel forced to downgrade because of size inconsistency.  How hard can it be to make a molded shoe conform to size?"

You don't really think about how light shoes are until you put Crocs on. In fact, I liked them so much I bought a second pair to wear out and about. I never thought it would happen but I am truly a Crocs lover now! To be fair, I don't love the way they look, and my feet sometimes get cold so I bought socks. (Yes, I went there!)

For both of us they are a bit large so I would say go down about half a size. We like wearing them after a shower at the gym (where flip flops for the shower) to air out or feet. Sometimes we where them at home however, they attract dog hair like nobody's business. There are people who have videos and instructions on how to remove pet hair from your carpet with these things. So on carpet and wood floor they are great for them but that is not my purpose. They feel great so I will keep wearing them."

Never owned a pair and always thought they looked ugly, and never understood why there was this attraction to them. I have wide feet, 12 4E, I was skeptical the 12 M size was going to be too tight.  They fit perfectly, I guess because they are wide to start off with, although if I had narrow feet I probably wouldn't be too happy with them. The things are super comfortable and around the house, I wear them with strap up front so I can just slip them off and on like a pair of slippers.  When I go out I wear the strap in the rear to secure them completely on my feet. They may not be the most beautiful pair of footwear, but I have worn them out dancing, even playing golf. They're great, that's why I bought this second pair. I was also skeptical about the little knobs on the inside of the shoe, but these I found kind of massage your feet and make them feel good."

These are very cute, very flattering and I'm pretty sure, even though I've only worn them around my house, they are going to be my summer favs."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,RA36833PW22VL,"September 7, 2017",3,Straps too high for a med-narrow or flat foot.,"Great looking shoe & perfect as a true flat (i.e.: no added height in the heel) but unfortunately the straps are not adjustable and are just too high for a medium narrow/flat foot like mine. I'm normally an 8 1/2 medium (was a 7 1/2 narrow until walking all over Manhattan  for 18 yrs!) so my feet are just a bit on the narrow width side.  I bought the 8 medium since 8 1/2's were not available; it fit perfectly in length.  I included pictures of a Crocs thong sandal Ive had for a  couple of years to show the difference in fit. They fit perfectly but the heel is just too much of a wedge, which throws my back out of balance. I really have come to love the light weight and supportive footbed of crocs and have ordered several different styles to see if I could find the perfect style for me. If they could combine the height of this flat shoe with the strap height of the thong, I'd have the perfect summer & around the house shoe for me. This flat shoe would be good for those with higher arches or wider feet."

My feet become very uncomfortable in enclosed shoes, and these were recommended. They are extremely comfortable, a lot more supportive than a flip flop or a ballet flat, and following the recommendation to size down for half sizes yielded a perfect fit."

It also looks as if the sandal's soles might pry open where the glue is missing due to flexing during normal use. Only time will tell. If it doesn't pry for at least 3 months, then I will update with 5 stars. Other than the above, the sandal is nice and size fits for me. Update August 25 2017: Use it almost every day for cooking in kitchen and it is still holding together in one piece. Update January 24 2018: Still in one piece and no signs of soles peeling apart at all. Have used it daily for about 2 hours a a day."

Huge downside is the straps are not adjustable and they do not fit a normal foot. The length was perfect but the bands around the foot are huge!!!! If you suffer from diabetes and have swollen feet then these are the shoes for you."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,R7PIFZG2TRL7Z,"February 3, 2017",5,It was discontinued but these feel as good as the Cleos,"I previously had a pair with nearly the same design except for the twist on top. It was discontinued but these feel as good as the Cleos. Both are  wonderful!  The secret is the fully molded inner sole. Most shoes are flat so that the inner sole is nearly parallel to the outer. This type of shaped but flexible inner sole feels like a human foot! It snuggles up to the foot instead of waiting until it softens up inside enough to mold to the foot. I also know that many people loved them because they went fast, especially my favorite color, fuchsia. I would have bought more otherwise"
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,R2DRJNXIHHSNWM,"May 22, 2018",4,Try these on at a store first to make sure the straps fit your foot.,"Edit: Okay, a couple of months later and I have changed my review from 2 stars to 4. Yes, the top straps are still way loose and yes, I still wish they fit better - BUT, I have learned to walk in these in such a way that they no longer slip and now they are so comfortable that I find myself choosing this sandal over all my others - if I don't have to walk a great distance. I wouldn't use them on a trip to Disneyland but for around town they are comfortable enough that I am ordering a second pair. Original Review: This sandal is cute and would be comfortable IF the straps fit properly. There is a 1 - 1 1/2"" gap between the top of my foot and the strap nearest the ankle. The other straps are loose too. Consequently my foot slides around on the foot bed making it uncomfortable to walk more than a block or two. I even sized down - I usually wear 8 1/2 but went with a size 8. I don't think going down to a size 7 would help. The foot bed would be too small and I believe the straps would still be too high."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,R2F55PSTOPLT42,"February 28, 2018",3,"Good product, stylish, but could use some design changes","I do like this sandal style and it's great for walking on the beach over rocks and into the water. But there are two drawbacks to it that I would change in order for it to rate 5 stars from me: 1. the surface of the plastic is not smooth enough to avoid collecting dust. The area around the toes is a dust magnet and always looks dirty if you wear them in a beach environment and though dry sand. The other Crocs sandals I have have a smooth surface and doesn't ever look dirty. 2. The upper strap is a bit too big and doesn't hold the sandal firmly against the foot. It allows it to flop a quite a bit which makes it more difficult to keep on my foot in sand and water. I kept the sandals anyway and am using them every day at the beach. They are stylish and easy to put on if your feet have sand on them which was a huge plus for me. I use a 7 1/2 size shoe so I ordered the 8 just like I have for the other Crocs sandals I own. They all fit perfectly in length and toe area except for the strap issue on this particular model. If they change the strap design and plastic surface, I would buy it again."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,R21CYYLCAYZKMF,"March 21, 2019",5,"Lightweight, comfortable, & stylish!","These Crocs are great! I normally wear a size 9.5 and I bought these in size 9 (black with white on the bottom) and they fit perfect. The straps are not tight, they slip on easily, and they look very stylish as well. I’ve been looking for house shoes because we have hardwood & tile floors and my feet usually hurt. We live in a warmer climate so I wasn’t looking to buy traditional (warm) slippers. These crocs are exactly what I needed. Should last for years. The price was decent too $23 + tax. I also have a pair of Kaydee Crocs in size 9. I’ve had them for a few years and they have held up well."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,R1AI2KENEU92S2,"May 27, 2017",5,Wonderful look & function,"I love the sandals! They needed no break-in. They were comfortable & resilient from the first wearing. The cushioning in the footbed is surprisingly supportive & comfortable even though the profile is quite slim. I love the way they look, not clunky at all. And I like that they are easy off & on but don't fall off while walking. They're a real bull's eye. I plan to buy another pair."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,R32YEF73X98T71,"August 5, 2017",5,In love with these sandals!,"I love these sandals, even more than I thought I would.  The colors are great (I have them in violet, water and gray) and I love the style, but was delighted to find that they make my almost-wide feet look slimmer.  (They camouflage my bunions with the diagonal strap.)  They are also very supportive, which I did not expect, and I wear them at home and when I go out in casual clothes.  The available colors match everything, and of course they can get wet with no problem and dry fast.  There is only one thing I would suggest when you first get used to them.  If they slip off a little, your pinky toe can hit the strap, but I quickly got used to keeping them on straight.  I'm between a regular and a wide width depending on style, and these fit me perfectly.  Also, they still look new after wearing them almost non-stop for 2 months or so.  I hope they continue to be available; I would buy more pairs in any new colors.  A great buy!"
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,R2FA56G129YVTW,"August 17, 2018",5,My Go To Shoes,"These sandals are so comfortable and convenient. I use them around the house, in the garden, to the swimming pool, walking on the beach, walking around the neighborhood . . . If they get dusty or muddy, they're easily washed off. They are stylish enough to wear with skirts and dresses, casual enough to wear to yoga. They are light weight and durable so I take them in my suitcase when traveling. I usually wear a 6.5 medium width, but since these came only in whole sizes, I ordered size 7. They fit fine. I also ordered a different style of Crocs, but these are the ones I wear day after day. I wish I had ordered these in two or three colors--I like them that much. They are proving to be a good value."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,R36SOZWAHZOM6U,"September 22, 2017",5,Comfortable enough to walk 8 hours in!,"By far, the most comfortable sandals I have ever owned. They are super comfortable with great arch support and extremely easy to clean. Whenever they get dirty, I give them a quick rinse and scrub, and they dry rapidly. I recently went on vacation and forgot my walking shoes. I walked in these sandals for about 8-9 hours per day for a week and I barely felt them. These really are amazing sandals. This is my third pair. I just love them!"

I love the way they look on my feet and after walking around in them on my carpeted floor for a couple of hours with tags intact, i decided that they fit perfectly and to keep them. Today is day 3. I wore them to work and around the house after work and now they have loosened and they keep falling off. I'm sure i cant return or exchange them now because they look worn. Man am i ever disappointed. I love them but really dont want to risk tripping and falling.  Buy a size smaller, ladies."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,RD70213HZ5IGN,"June 20, 2018",1,I wanted to love these sooo much,"I wanted to love these sooo much. First, the color. I got the teal and grey. In the pic (at least on my computer) the teal was much more bright and the grey was almost white. In reality the teal is dark and the grey is a true medium grey. But it was still beautiful. The fit was spot on. I wear a 10 and there was no extra room, nor were they tight. They felt comfortable and the straps were neither tight or loose. That's where the good ends. I walked a total of maybe 25 feet in them and my foot slid off the back of the shoe further and further with each step. I thought maybe I hadn't put my foot as far forward as I thought so I tried again. Same results. Like it happens almost comically fast. I thought well maybe I had the strap further forward than I though. I adjusted and tried one more time. I have never had a shoe do this to me in my life. No matter what adjustments I made the shoe just wants to slide off my foot. I bought these for running around airports in but there is no way this would be comfortable, let alone safe. So disappointed but back they go"
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,R1I84MTWXU916S,"December 25, 2019",4,Slightly loose but still wears just fine!,"I'm a size 8, but these were slightly lose, but given that I was just going to use them for the beach or ""shower shoes"" mostly, that was no problem to me, but might be for someone else, that want to wear them out. However, they are SO COMFORTABLE, and I usually stick with everything in Skechers, but these Crocs feel great and I have a hard time with bone pain, so that is saying alot. Also, I swell slightly in my feet sometimes and they actually fit perfect then, so if I didn't have the size 8, I wouldn't be able to wear them comfortably on my swelling days, so that is great. Even when I'm not swelling, they still fit fine. It's NOT a looseness to wear they will fall off, it is just a looseness in ""look"" when looking at the straps where they don't always lay exactly right against the top of your foot, so they ""look"" slightly too big if someone were actually studying your footwear, so who really cares?, unless you are concerned with that sort of thing. I wear these suckers around the house as my house shoes, with or without socks, wear them in the shower, so they get washed regularly and still keeps it's quality.. that much exposure to water hasn't broke them down, yet. They're great! I was blessed to have found them. My sister was interested in them, because of their interesting simple style, but when I went to buy her a pair for her Dec 31st birthday, they are sold out of 7 and 8's at the moment in White. I may buy her the sky blue and white ones."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,R3JYFNPQLLTRSS,"July 1, 2019",1,"NOT REAL CROCS,  NO QUALITY","These are not the Croc sandals of a few years ago. The most come fortable sandal I ever wore... everywhere. The older model had two straps across; the second having a legitimate Croc movement at attachment site. I saw these & thought the split into 3 straps would make them even better. I immediately bought 2 pair never even wore one pair). It took using them a few times over 2-3 weeks I suddenly questioned why my feet hurt so much when I used them? I compared them to the older Croc sandals. Wow. What a difference in quality. The new ones had no arch support, nor a thick ribbed sole, as did the older pair. They were basically thin Chinese knock offs that I'd expect to pay $5.00 for on a NYC street. So I find a box to fit both, wrap it, ready for return label from Amazon BUT NO, I missed the 30 day return by a couple of days. Great, $60.00 wasted on garbage that I thought I was investing in my comfort. Crocs, you should be ashamed of putting your logo on this way below Croc quality we've come to rely upon. I took photos to attach, but cannot do so. Believe me, these new ones are a joke."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,RQRFILPMZT52I,"July 25, 2018",2,"Too flimsy, not enough arch support","Background: Trying to find a comfortable & ergonomic flip flop for summer. Pros: - Comfortable feel of the material on your skin. Cons: - So light it feels flimsy. It weighs about as much as a couple pieces of paper. - It has a very thin sole. I would not feel comfortable walking around outside with these shoes as I'm sure I would feel all the rocks and other stuff on the ground through the shoe. - The arch support is not in the right place, and there isn't enough of it."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Sandal Sport,B01H6ZR0BS,R1MKQV0NVYVNTQ,"July 17, 2019",5,Super comfy with a touch (just a touch) of class,"Let's face it, the name Crocs isn't usually associated with haute couture, but these sandals actually do look quite nice and boy are they comfortable. I love the little nubbies on the insole which give my feet a tiny massage as I walk. I normally wear a 7.5 shoe but the size 7 is just perfect. I would probably live in them all summer long except they have no arch support and I have found it helpful at my advanced age of 67 to have that feature."

My advice is if you have a wide foot and are in between sizes then order up a size! When I put on the 9’s they were beautiful and sexy and fit perfect, until I started walking, then my foot came out and I couldn’t wear them. Because I brought them on vacation and needed them, I cut the strap off and was able to walk poolside with them. I give them a five star even though they didn’t fit me because they are so sexy and comfortable, it’s not the shoes fault I ordered a size down when I should have ordered up. I will buy these again in a size ten because they really are a sexy shoe and being crocs they are comfy. I will update my review when I order the larger size to make sure it’s good advice. The way my foot came out was due to it being a wide foot, I asked my husband to try them on as he is a narrow foot and he had no problem with his foot coming out, that is why I give the advice to order up if you have a wide foot and are in between sizes."

I have hard wood floors and am super pregnant, so every step was beginning to really hurt.  I've heard good things about these, so I bought the cheapest color in size huge because my feet are in fact, huge.  They fit fine and have definitely eliminated a lot of my foot pain, however, my feet are sitting in a sauna.  I have to wear socks with them and I still have super sweaty (and not to mention, stinky) feet. I'm not one to have ever had a sweaty or stinky foot issue, but in these I'm queen gross foot.  I knew this would be an issue to an extent, but wow, this is ridiculous.  I'll switch between these and my gel flip flops (which don't do much for me) throughout the day, just to give my feet a breather.  Are they comfortable?  Yes.  Would I have bought them if I knew how my feet would handle this material?  Nah."

This was something we only realized after leaving on vacation. Our 12 year old constantly complained that the one was too small and the other was too large. He had to wear them until we could find a store to buy him flip flops and so we couldn't return them by the time we got back as they had been worn.

I have worn a pair of Crocs clogs for over 10 years and decided it was time to replace them. The clogs now are nothing like the clogs of years ago. And sad to say the quality of what was a great buy is gone. This clog is now a plastic of some sort and the insole is not any more comfortable than a regular pair of shoes. I normally wear 6.5US and got a size 7. They are tight across the foot when using the strap, my foot is pushed forward and is uncomfortable. But without the strap the clog doesn't seem to fit right.

I've been making fun of them for the past decade but when we moved into a new place with hard floors, I needed something to wear around the house. I stand/walk a lot at work and wanted something that was very comfortable. Got these bad boys and couldn't be happier. After a long day in dress shoes I look forward to wearing these when I get home. Great for working around the house and going up and down the stairs on hard flooring. I flip the strap up and go for the clog configuration. The look better that way and stay on fine without the strap behind your heel. Also nice that they are pretty grippy. I wear them cooking in the kitchen and don't have any issues when I spill stuff on the floor. I would definitely recommend these to anyone. They don't look the coolest but I'm a dad now so I'm fine with that. They are a much more comfortable upgrade from flip flop or slipper for wearing around the house. My only regret is not getting a cool color. If you're gonna get crocs you might as well go big!"

They have helped me to see the beauty of the world and give me the confidence to face whatever obstacles life may throw my way. I can now walk outside with confidence. These shoes, these marvelous shoes, help me to live my life to the fullest not only in style but with such comfort no amount of words can begin to describe. I will now continue to live my life with an open mind to such fashion statements. No more will I live with my head hung low, but now I wear my crocs with pride. Sports mode empowers me while relaxed mode truly is the epitome of serenity. Crocs have also been the glue that has bonded me and one my best friends.

They have no arch support like the better Crocs do, the rubber is hard and not flexible and soft like other Crocs.  And they are much too large for a womens B width foot.  In fact, these Crocs actually hurt my feet and legs when I wore them out.  I will never wear these Crocs again.  In fact, I am taking them to Goodwill today and I just got them! I have 2 pairs of older Crocs that cured my Achilles tendinitis and plantar facshitis (spelling sorry), that mold to my feet and are so soft and cushiony and non slip.

You can draw your own conclusions from a glance at the photo. Also, this pair seemed smaller/tighter than the original pair, despite supposedly being the exact same size.

The change was both startling and disappointing. The size of the new pair is visibly smaller than my original pair. The little rise at the back of the footbed is almost non-existent so my feet slide out backwards as I walk. The nubs on the footbed are so coarse it's like walking barefoot on gravel. Overall, they are very tight compared to the originals.  In fact so tight that I had to reorder in a larger size."

This is a recurring problem that is usually improved by wearing Crocs.  I took a closer look at the shoes and was shocked to see that they aren't real.

The Crocs I've always purchased in the past ran at least a size too large and very wide.  So, I ordered a size smaller than I usually wear; but the Croc slip-on I received is like a woman's size 8 regular (and I wear and 11 wide).  I can't even get my foot into it.

Crocs,Classic Clog|Comfortable Slip-on Casual Water Shoe,B005PQQ3IW,RJC57TJMSG4HI,"July 4, 2018",5,Awesome,"These guys are amazing.  For years, I avoided them despite of the hype some time ago.  The funny thing is that I was always looking for a shoe that can work as a slipper because that would be so practical for traveling. The regular clogs don’t have enough backing on the heel to be a shoe.  I got these slippers once and tried to use them as shoes but they have no soles and so very uncomfortable to walk on hard surfaces and got really wet when it was raining.  The soft shoes have too much backing on the heel and so cannot be used as a slipper. Enter the Croc’s innovative design that has a movable heel strap so it’s a slipper when you’re at home and a shoe when you’re moving around. In the picture, they look solid so you know they will work on hard surfaces.  My concern was if they are comfortable because it looks like hard plastic but it is really some rubber or silicone material so quite soft and comfy. The only thing is the sizing is off.  I wear 9.5 and got a 10 but I should have gotten a 9.  It is loose but not really an issue except if you plan to drive wearing them.  I have a manual car and I stalled the car when I drove it wearing these for first time. I don’t think looks is a problem and very subjective.  In this case, they become so iconically ugly that many ppl think they’re beautiful now."

I got married this summer, so now that I can start letting myself go I decided to order a pair for myself. They're great. Super lightweight and comfortable. The only gripe I have is that they run a little big. I wear a size 10.5 and, based on other reviews, I ordered a size down. Even the size 10's fit best with socks. Still very comfortable though. If you find yourself at a point in life where you want comfortable shoes and don't have to impress anyone - I highly recommend these."

This year, they got full of paint due to painting our house.  There still is nothing wrong with them other than the paint.  So, I decided to treat myself to a new pair.  The new ones are stiff, the nubs on the inside hurt and the toe box really wants to yank off my baby toenail, even though I trim them weekly.  Returning.  Way to screw up a great product, Crocs.  I soaked my old ones in soap and water overnight, dried them in the sun, stuffed newspaper inside and gave them 2 coats of Rustoleum flat black spray paint.  Viola!  Like new.  I am now a former Crocs customer.  The old ones fit like a glove and are the most comfy shoes I own."

I first discovered a cheap copy of these at Walmart, and I loved how they fit and how easily they slip on and off.  So I was pleased to find the original brand here on Amazon.  I live in the desert, and our home is kept on the warm side too, so I definitely need models (like this classic model) with the holes in the side and top - the one thing I didn't like about my cheap knock-offs is they didn't have those holes, and my feet (with or without socks) were uncomfortably hot and clammy inside the house.  Another good feature is being able to toss the shoes into a bucket of soapy water to clean them after slogging in the mud outside. For me, the strap is crucial.  If I fold the strap up to the front out of the way, my heel sometimes slips out over the back end of the shoe, so I hope they never eliminate the strap! My feet are 11 1/2, and very wide (12 4E New Balance 408s fit well), and the size 12 Crocs fit good - I am going to try a size 13 next for kicking around the house and see if they are even easier to slip on/off."

I wasn't excited about the glossy black appearance, but since I only wear them to drive from my garage to the pool, walk about 200 feet across hot concrete, stick them in a locker while I swim, then reverse the process to go home, I can overlook my own fashion faux pas.  The heel strap keeps them properly positioned on my feet while driving, and the drain holes in the toes make them great for poolside.  I have falling arches & these make the walk from car to poolside & back so much less painful than foam flip-flops - and as stated before, I feel confident driving my car (automatic transmission) whereas with flip-flops, I'd change in & out of socks & shoes, while my kids wait for me to get the car started & the A/C going.  If these last half as long as my old Crocs Mammoth clogs (10+ years so far & still have a little bit of tread on the soles), then these are the best deal in footwear for my Fashion Tone-Deaf Curmudgeon Community.

I wear them all of the time!  When they stretch (they do a bit from time to time) out I put them in the dryer for a BIT and wear them immediately.  Do NOT leave these in a hot car.  The photo shoes 2 pair of size 8 - the 2 shoes in the middle are the pair that I left in a hot car for a day - the far left and far right shoe are the normal size.

Then one day I found these in a store and thought they were cute, while being good for work.  They were about twice as much in the store, so I ordered them off of Amazon.  When I first got them, they felt really large.  But the next day when I put them on, they fit just right.  These have already become my go-to shoe.  They're great for Spring, they're great for work.  They're easy to slip off so I can sit at my desk barefoot, but also easy to put right back on.  I can wear them to the store, to a ball game, and probably to a wedding if I wanted to  They are super comfortable.  I told my co-worker all my work shoes in the future are going to be Crocs.  The shoes I usually wear just have no cushioning.  Not only do these feel great on my feet, but they have a great tread and I feel very secure and safe when I'm taking the stairs, or running across the street."

I have flat feet and plantar fasciitis. I have tried so many other brands (Dansko was the previous top one for me, but Ryka worked, too). I have to wear the Mary Jane/ballet slipper style because of foot problems. The reviews convinced me to try crocs (as did prime returns being an option) and they were great! I can't wear them without socks because they still (after 3 weeks of constant wear) rub the back of my feet raw/bloody. With socks it's fine, and since they stretched out, better. These were so great, in fact, that I bought another pair. These stretched out quite a bit, so I sized down, because I want to be able to wear them without socks. The pair I initially received was damaged (no fuss exchange for those), but were so much more comfortable in the heel area than the first pair. This leads me to think that quality control is not consistent. They still get 5 stars because I can walk without (much) pain. Photos are of the 3 weeks used (black) and the new ones, same size (brown). I sent the same size back and exchanged for an 8 because when comparing the two 9 sized pairs of shoes, it was clear how much the originals stretched and I wanted a tighter fit. I tried the Alice Mary Jane (also crocs) but those didn't work for me. I wanted a closed heel because I do have trouble with rocks/sand getting in the Kadees. The Mary Janes were much bigger overall (would have had to go down 2 full sizes from my normal, non-crocs size) and they rubbed the side of my foot when they were still too large."

They were about one size too big when I first got them, but I did like other people suggested & put them in the dryer on medium for about five minutes (don't forget them!). They fit fine after that. Because you're basically walking on foam, there's no real arch support. But, they really cushion your feet. I bought them to use instead of house slippers and for walking the dog in the rain. They'd be great for slippers when traveling since they are light as can be. The ones I bought were raspberry, and I worried that they might be purplish, but they're not. I attached some photos--the color doesn't photograph well. They're more of a dark pink, like the third photo, than the hot pink if the first. Really cute with capris!"

This color is very bright.  I love wearing these in the summer - I wear them the way some people wear flip flops.  Also the toe box in the Kadee is a little shorter than the Malindi -  see photo.

I have a hard time shopping for shoes because I have a wide foot with a narrow heel and a low arch. These look great on and fit like a glove! My feet don't hurt at all in these shoes as they did with other Crocs styles that I tried, and I love that this style is very versatile and goes with just about anything. I really like the espresso color that I bought because they are dark enough to wear with black or other dark colors, and still look great with earth-tones.

The second pair, floral, I bought yesterday at a crock store. Checks out that size 7 do fit me best still. Great fit. Size 7 and made in China. Third pair, brown, I bought here. The price was right and the conviniance was perfect. I figured I could just get the same size as the first pair I got. Turned out to be WAY to big. I didn't have a choice but to use them, the old ones were to worn in. I wore them for about two weeks before I rolled my heal. Ya, don't wair shoes that are too big for you! Anyway, the difference? The brown ones are size 7, made in Mexico. The seams are raggedy, the size way wrong, and the bottoms already look like they're wairing too fast. Ultimately. Would I but again? Yes.

I don't love the look of crocs, but at this point comfort was the priority. They do not disappoint! Very very comfy. I wear them to work ina business casual environment, I oddly got a compliment that they are cute. A few things to consider: crocs only come in whole sizes. I wear 8.5 and I always get 8 in crocs. Even with larger, swollen feet this is the correct size to avoid slipping. Also, it is summer time which means my feet sweat quite a bit in these. I clean them out with a clorox wipe about once a week."

So I also wanted something that I could wear in the water. I chose the pink/fuchsia because I wanted to girly them up a bit. I love them! They look more purple in the picture, but are actually more of the typical hot pink, which was a great surprise! I usually wear an 8 or 8.5. I got a size eight in these and they fit my feet perfectly! If anything, I would say they run a tad bigger. They slip on so easily and are so comfortable. I felt obligated to write a review, because I was on the fence about getting them, and I am so glad I did! So give them a try!"
Crocs,Women's Kadee Flat,B003XE1CBG,R209AKFR93L9H7,"January 6, 2017",5,Order The Smaller Size if You Are Between Sizes,"The Animal Print Kadee Ballet I ordered before this one fit a bit snug so I was considering ordering a size up instead but glad I didn't. I'm a 8.5 - 9 and these fit me just fine in size 8. And my feet are not narrow. And remember, these things tend to stretch after a while. Also, to avoid getting blisters, for the first week I wore these while having taped some cotton on my heel. After it was broken in, I never got any blisters! So note your pressure points and pad for the first few days and you'll be ok. If not, I can almost guarantee you will get blisters and be sorry you didn't take my advice. But it's worth it. These shoes are so comfortable and supportive you'll be able to stand for hours without any pain. Also, the holes at the top let in a lot of air when you move your toes so your feet will not be sweaty. I would recommend these shoes to anyone who has to stand for long hours!"
Crocs,Women's Kadee Flat,B003XE1CBG,R3GPSMTI06W264,"March 27, 2019",3,Comfortable but they will strectch out on you!,"No one on the planet can ever discount the comfort level of a crocs shoe, trust me on that! This is my second crocs flats. I can dress it up and wear them to work, dress it down and wear them to the beach. if your dress is long enough you even ware them to a friends wedding :) Now my issue with the crocs flats is that they stretch. I am true size 9. when I bought my first flat shoe from crocs I ordered a size 9, the fit was great and of course the undeniable comfort level. now fast forward to 6 months after purchasing the shoe I had to stop wearing it. The show stretched to almost a half size bigger than my feet. As noted crocs are comfortable. So I reorder the same flats but I went a size down. I ordered a size 8. but almost a year after I am now looking to purchase another one; as the size 8 has, of course, stretched out. the once cute fitting shoe now looks like a boat on my feet. PS: I live in Jamaica, So I am not sure if that has anything to with the shoes stretching out so fast.  note also that I don't have this issue with the flip flops."
Crocs,Women's Kadee Flat,B003XE1CBG,RLE5S2MDLPQWE,"December 9, 2015",5,Loving them!,"These were delivered early in the morning. I opened the box, kicked off my shoes, put these on, and went to work. (Risky decision - if they weren't comfortable, I'd be stuck in them all day.) I love them! They are supportive, but still have some give to them where it's necessary. They are super comfortable and best of all, they more or less look like normal flats, so I can wear them to work with any other outfit I would normally pair with flats. I had been buying flats so often, because of how easily they wore down or being outside in the rain. These are going to be so easy to wash off and keep clean."
Crocs,Women's Kadee Flat,B003XE1CBG,R12ORVJF3SEO6D,"January 4, 2020",3,Best affordable option for comfortable work shoes,"So I worked at a large car rental facility at an very busy airport for a few months I walked five to seven miles a day on average, in a hot garage, in Florida. It took me a long time to find a shoe that was good enough and I tested LOTS of shoes while there. most lasted me a couple of weeks before they had a hole in the bottom or were too smelly to bear. these seem to be the best affordable option. They lasted me about four to five weeks. After a couple days they kind of mold to your foot shape and become pretty comfortable. I didn't ever wear inserts with these, whereas with other shoes, I'd have to get new pair of inserts almost weekly. There is a pretty big downside though, there are these bumps on the inside of your shoe that kind of act as cheese graters for your feet. And if you do a lot of walking, all the skin that's being grated away mixes with the sweat (because these are rubber shoes and don't breathe at all), and the rubber (probably the asphalt that got in through the hole at the heel too) and creates this nasty black goopy skin mucus in your shoes. When you get home your feet are covered in dried black smelly gunk. This is easily fixable with a wipe down from a Clorox wipe or a hose down. I've never had sweaty feet until I started that job, and other shoes would get too smelly too quickly, but these were fine again after a quick wash down which I appreciated. This is a pair of my old Crocs and my newer pair."

They are clown shoes.,"I’ve been buying this exact Crocks Kadee Flats shoes for a few years. I’ve purchased 5 pairs for myself as I absolutely love them. I am a size 8 and the first 4 pairs fit perfectly. They are the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever had. I just bought a new pair, my 5th pair and they are way to big. They fit like clown shoes and they are much stiffer. I looked at my old pairs and they were made in Mexico. The new clown size shoes were made in China. I’m sending them back to Amazon in hopes the replacement pair will fit. I will post my results when I get the replacement pair."
Crocs,Women's Kadee Flat,B003XE1CBG,R7HIU7FT1HM3R,"January 8, 2019",1,There's no such thing as a Croc that fits Size 7 feet...,"In June, I caught a super-fungus & have to have a specific Crosslite shoe of the right size, or else my feet get eaten alive by the fungus. I ordered a 7M / 7W Kadee Crocs, 1 from Amazon & 1 from Crocs themselves, & BOTH said ""7W"" but ended up being a size 9, which was acceptable b/c they didn't end up holding moisture against my feet. Amazon told me to try 1 size lower, so I ended up w/ 2 dangerously tight 6M pairs, which were a disaster re. the fungus. NOW I've ordered another 7M pair b/c that was my only option for something that wouldn't cause my feet to retain heat & moisture against them. This pair arrived today & THEY'RE THE SAME TINY SIZE AS THE 6M! Idk what to do & the ones that fit got a hole in them, which brings its own fungal disaster, hence me ordering a new pair on emergency over the weekend! Basically, there's no way to get the right size shoe from Crocs, & that's the only material I can use on my feet. Can't even put a pair of socks on. I have NO IDEA what size to order, at this point. UPDATE: I went by Crocs size chart recommendations anew, & got a 9M to fit my size 7 feet, & they sent me fricking CLOWN SHOES that are way too long to be anything smaller than a 10. They are falling off my feet if I walk on even slightly uneven terrain. I can't return them b/c the fungus I'm dealing w/ is highly contagious. I have to throw away all paper, cardboard, & cloth that I brush against. Amazon has made it so difficult for chronically ill & disabled people to deal w/ screw-ups like this. Last important order, I was sent the wrong herbal medicine sold under the same name of what I actually needed, so I was stuck w/ my sinus infection for 3 more weeks while Amazon 'worked out the details'! Idk what to do. I can't wait any longer for the right shoes, & I can't deal w/ Amazon CS 1 more time! Smh.  -Account holder's daughter"
Crocs,Women's Kadee Flat,B003XE1CBG,R1I5EOTR50640F,"January 24, 2020",3,Not horribly bad!,"*Update* I continued to try to wear them but they are honestly too uncomfortable for me, which isn't much of a surprise. I intend on sending them back, as the toe area never stretched out enough and they are rubbing blisters on me. I have fat, flat feet that don't exactly look great in any shoe. I also have long toes, so finding a pair that doesn't show ""toe cleavage"" is pretty rare. These are no exception on me. I typically wear 9.5 wide or 10 wide. I bought these in the size 10 and they do fit pretty well. The toe box is pretty roomy, though my pinky is a tiny bit annoyed at the moment. I just recieved them 2 hours ago and I've been wearing them to break them in. I am pleasantly surprised by the heel. No irritation on the back and its soft and squishy on the heel. I also tend to sweat in shoes. These are causing some sweating just wearing them around the house. I'm hoping that changes as they mold to my feet. The great part is, these will be extremely easy to clean because of the croc material. So I don't expect to have stinky feet. Although I don't think I will enjoy them in the Arizona summers. These are more for spring/fall/winter for me. I am overweight so it is always important to me to feel supported in the heel without the back rubbing painful blisters. 9 times out of 10, I don't keep the shoes I order online because they just don't fit right. These actually do. They are cuter than I expected them to be too. The only thing I will say is although the black is black, I would say it leans more toward a very dark gray. I'm giving them 4 stars because I think overall they will be a nice addition to wear on occasion. They are definitely more casual than dressy and I'm a casual kind of lady. I will continue to wear them unconfortably for a while and update if things change."
Crocs,Women's Kadee Flat,B003XE1CBG,RY2OUM04U3QEZ,"October 12, 2017",5,"Unbelievably comfortable, better than buying directly from Crocs","I previously purchased a pair of Crocs flats directly from the Crocs website, but that turned out to be a mistake.  The shoes were great, but their policies and customer service were awful, so this time I decided to buy through Amazon instead. My previous pair were incredibly comfortable, and being plastic, they were super-easy to clean.  I wore them with to work with slacks, on the weekends with jeans, and out on the boat since they're slip resistant as well.  So while I did not like the color (the black was more of a really dark gray), when the soles became worn from wearing them 24/7, I knew I wanted another pair of Crocs. This pair is much better than my first one.  For one, the color is actually black, not that faded version I got before.  The venting is better as well, with open areas along the heels, and because there is a bit more lift in the heel than in my old ones, they're even more comfortable.  I also like the more ""rugged"" tread on the bottom -- it should take me a bit longer to wear these down, so I'll get more time out of them before having to rebuy.  They fit perfectly and look great with either my nicer work clothes or my bum weekend wear. Most importantly, though, Amazon's policies are much more customer-friendly.  When Crocs dropped the price after I paid but before they even shipped, they wouldn't honor their own price.  I could have returned them, but the return postage/fees would have eaten up the savings entirely.  So obviously it makes more sense to buy here on Amazon, where the prices are generally better, and shipping & returns are often free. UPDATE: I've worn the hell out of these for the past year, and they're still wonderfully comfortable and in good shape.  In fact, I haven't worn any other shoes but these in the past 12 months.  I am, however, walking a bit more, so while these definitely have some life left in them, the rugged soles have worn down quite a bit.  I figured now was as good a time as any to buy another pair, and while I looked at several other styles, I just kept coming back to these.  Easily the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned! ANOTHER UPDATE:  Just bought my third pair of these.  The first and second pairs are still in good enough condition to wear while I'm out and about, but the soles have certainly worn down a bit, which is why I opted for new ones.  Still love them!"

I've seen from the brand thus far. I have > 10 pairs of crocs (yes, this is where my hard earned paycheck is going), so I'm a little obsessed. However, this was also the MOST uncomfortable pair I've ever worn. I'm a 8.5 W in standard shoes, and a 9 in athletics. I usually size up to a 9 in crocs. The 9 in this seemed like it fit length wise, but would slip out from the back and shove my feet forward after walking in it for a bit. The front of my toes got extremely pinched, and I had blisters everywhere you could imagine from all the friction back and forth. The sole and the back liner was comfy on their own but did nothing to alleviate this torture. In less than half a day of a bit of strolling around, my feet looked like they came out of a battle zone. I'm not sure who I would actually recommend this shoe to, because it's not just a problem with the width (technically, the width felt fine overall, until I started walking). I thought I could get away with comfy wedges, but this was not the easy way out I was hoping for. Instead, I found an awesome pair of Lifestrides and have settled with that as my go to.

These shoes literally feel like I’m wearing traditional Crocs, but just my heel being elevated. The cushioning inside is firm to support my arches while still have a soft to the touch lining. The heel is a wedge so there is none of that discomfort from wearing thin heels. Plus the ball of my foot doesn’t cramp nor do my toes get switch Cons: they need to make half sizes!!! I’m a 7 1/2. The size are alright but a little too big. So my feet slide around in them. So now my pinky toes feel raw. Cons: these shoes look like they’re made of rubber.

As a college professor, I need a respectable navy wedge that would match with my regalia but also march across a sometimes-muddy quad. These were more than perfect, looking stylish rather than like cheap rubber, matching the outfit, easily managing the terrain, and were comfortable all day.

I originally bought a size 10 since that's what my other pairs of Crocs are, but they were too big - my heels kept slipping out as I walked. I returned those and bought a size 9 instead. They were pretty snug in the toes but otherwise felt good, so I thought maybe I just needed to break them in a little. They did in fact stretch out a bit after an hour or so of wear, but they also stretched out lengthwise, so my heels slip out of these too. But don't worry, that doesn't stop these shoes from digging into the backs of my ankles. As an added bonus, my feet sweat like crazy in these, so they squeak as I walk. Very classy. I have never been more excited to take off a pair of shoes in my life. I hope I can return these because seriously what is this."

At first I thought I needed to go down a size, but then I realized it was just the shoe's design.

The shoe didn't hug my foot, so there was a lot of ""folding"" even when I was just standing still and it was really highlighted when I would actually step back on my foot (if that makes sense?). I love Crocs, but some styles just don't work for me.  If you have wider, flatter feet, stay away from these.  I ordered an 8.  FYI, old Crocs flip-flops (the Kadee) fit pretty good in size 8.  The newer Kadee (in stores as of now, May 2018), are too small for me in size 8.  So buyer beware if you are just now starting to wear Crocs.  And some Crocs work best for me in a 9? Like the Lina flat.  This is why I wish there were half-sizes..."
Crocs,Women's Lina Wedge Pump,B01A6LFUDO,R2LXNWKEI9K819,"September 7, 2017",4,However the size 9 do fit great. They toe area has loosened up even in ...,"Small sizes and narrow toe - order up! I wear 8-8.5 size shoe. Not a single  9 in my closet.. until this one! The 8 was killer in the toe (although I have other Croc dress shoes that are 8), and despite trying to stretch it out- I realized there was no such luck. However the size 9 do fit great. They toe area has loosened up even in these with daily wear. Like most is my croc heels these are becoming super comfy to wear. I'm on my feet most of the day and at the end of the day, my feet aren't a bit Sore if I've had my Croc heels on!"

I tried heating up the toe part with a blow dryer and wearing thick socks with them to stretch them but nothing worked. I don't have particularly wide feet at all, but the way these shoes squished my toes was a new kind of torture."

I had an issue with quality control as one of the straps that was meant to hold my foot in was too long. It ended up being even with the back part of the shoe rendering it useless. The other shoe was fine and was about 1/4 to 1/2 inch shorter allowing for my foot to be secure. Of of the other 3 pairs I have this is the only defect but heard quality had diminished since they are made in Mexico now and not China.

Crocs,Men's and Women's Literide Clog | Casual Slip on | Comfort Technology,B07886HBSX,R3I6JJNJ7P3JFR,"September 11, 2018",5,Amazingly Comfortable,"I'm giving these 5 stars mostly because my husband who LOATHES anything produced by Crocs...actually didn't hate these. I ordered the size that I normally wear in original Crocs, which usually feel a bit tight. Unfortunately, that same size in the Literide swallows my feet. So, husband got the wrong sized shoe and I ordered a size down. Which worked out for the best. Wore these at Disneyland and Las Vegas for a week each and I cannot believe how much foot pain was avoided by doing so. My normal rotation is to bring 3 pairs of shoes on theme parking/heavy walking trips: a pair of Keens sandals, a new pair of Sketchers Go-Walk, and Crocs mostly for wearing inside the hotel room. Every day I'd rotate to try and keep my feet from wearing down the shoes and inevitably my feet would be killing me after a few days. Not much exaggeration - there would be an intense pain as if the whole bottom of my foot was deeply bruised and set on fire. It'd be torture to walk so I'd hobble. I wore these Literide's for the first time this year and completely bypassed footpain. I was stunned. There's more cushion than the old Croc clogs, they are much lighter, and look so much better. This is the best shoe, period. My husband surprisingly agrees - he wore them every day for about 3 weeks on various vacation and conference attending. Highly recommend using some   on the top of your foot if you're not used to going sockless. I've tried various other sticks and gels but this stuff was also wonderful and super convenient to carry with you since the packets are so small."
Crocs,Men's and Women's Literide Clog | Casual Slip on | Comfort Technology,B07886HBSX,RKDTHR6166PLO,"March 31, 2019",4,Exellent Crocs!!!,"I've had four major lumbar surgeries and swear by Crocs.  My previous ones were both Duet Plus, but they've been discontinued.  So I searched around the Croc website and found these new LiteRide versions.  I can say, without exaggerating, that these are BETTER!  The footbed is true to their claim - squishier gel, but excellent arch support.  The outsole is the same durable and grippy stuff as always.  I love the new style of many more, smaller holes in the top surface, rather than less of the bigger holes.  And the slightly hooked heel hangs on to your foot a little better - you never have to use the strap, for any application, except maybe slogging through heavy, soft mud.  Like all Crocs, they go anywhere, wash off easily in the shower, and can be polished or sealed with Croc oil or any similar product to keep them looking great for years.  Get some - you will not be dissappointed. Additional note - a few reviewers say these are narrower.  This is true, but unless you have very side feet, this isn't an issue.  I wear shoes that are typically one width wider, and my Duets were a big floppy on my feet.  When I'd walk in water or in the rain on uneven surfaces, they'd move around a bit.  I never got blisters, but I would have rather had less play in roominess.  With these new LiteRides, in my opinion, the width is perfect - just the right amount of touch front to back, side to side, top to bottom. And the Amazon price was less than the Croc website, and that's without the Prime no cost shipping!"

I bought the first pair during a stop over in Puerto Rico while on a cruise 2 months ago. Liked them so much that I bought another pair to use as my home slippers. This style of Croc seems to have more cushion than the classic style and they are very comfortable as a result.  They are also great to wear by the pool, etc. and because of all the vent holes my feet do not sweat like they do with some other styles that I own.  Highly recommended Croc’s!"

While I like the more streamlined look and the foot bed is definitely soft and comfortable, It was nort as comfy or supportive as the old duet sport model that I'm still wearing to death now. As a matter fact there was less arch support  and for some odd reason my feet felt less stable in them rather than equally or more, which was a real disappointment. I wish they would just bring back the duet sport  and be done with it. It's the only model I've found to be comfortable while still being supportive and stable. I guess I'm just gonna stop buying crocs with the hope thatthat they will once again produce something like they used to."

Not original Vietnam crocs.,They Are decent but not as good as everybody else is raving about. They seem to fit in their narrower  then normal crocs do. What I love about crocs is the wide width for my fat feet. These seem to fit tighter around the instep and toebox. My little toe touches the edge of the croc and therefore I have to periodically readjust my foot so my foot fits better inside the croc.  They are comfortable as far as the foot bed goes however the fit leaves a little to be desired in this they only deserve three stars versus five stars if they fit perfectly. Update: After doing some research I found out that these pair of crocs that I purchased are in fact made in China and not the originals made in Vietnam. I have two different pair of crocs made in Vietnam and they are great fit. I’ve reduced my rating from three stars down to one star and I have requested a refund from Amazon. I sure wish they carried better quality made Vietnam ones and it’s a crapshoot as to what they’ll send you.

I measured my bare feet heel to toe and it was 11”. I ended up buying a size 11 Mens in this and it fit the length of my foot perfectly, not too much extra space. For reference, I wear 11.5 in Nike, Adidas, and Vans. If your measurements are like mine get a size 11 for sure. I took a pic of the size 11 next to my classic clogs size 10. Now onto the clogs. These are narrower than the traditional clogs. This is like the slim fit version of its cousin. The toe box is narrower and just the general profile is narrower so this is a heads up for people with wide feet. You might wanna size up for wide feet but the length will probably be too long. The clogs are very comfortable if you have heel pain and already as comfortable as my very worn in classic clogs. They also look more aesthetically pleasing."

This particular set though fits slightly differently  than others, and in my case, makes this croc fit not as well as all others--it is too small: I now figured it out: the white trim/banding around the shoe makes it better for walking in sloshy or wet areas, but it has no perforated holes as the regular crocs have in that area... in my case, it constrains some of my toes more than the regular crocs and so makes it too small to fit with the heel sling in place...so i have to use this pair strictly as clogs without the heel band.

Crocs,Crocband Clog | Comfortable Slip on Casual Water Shoe,B002LITTDS,R2H771DR2NIL1P,"December 11, 2018",5,Crocs are good for your feet!,Bought my first pair on a lark because they were on sale.  This purchase makes my 5th pair.  I have had several surgeries on my feet and right ankle so Crocs have made the perfect shoe because the toe box is very wide (to accommodate swollen feet) and the shoe bed provide arch support and an inch of solid cushioning.  That cushioning helps people with arthritic knees or bad backs in a way that no house shoe will ever do. *Do not leave your Crocs out in the direct sun or out in freezing temperatures because they will shrink or otherwise deteriorate since they are a rubber-like material.
Crocs,Crocband Clog | Comfortable Slip on Casual Water Shoe,B002LITTDS,R3N5TTST8XH1EV,"May 3, 2018",4,IMHO (with note about sizing...),"This was my first purchase of a Crocs product, so I didn't know what to expect. I read many reviews to understand why they are so popular, and figured that I would give them a try. One of the reviews that I read indicated that they run small so order one size up--I wear a men's size 11 so I ordered a size 12. The Crocs arrived and were TOO LARGE by approximately one size--I returned them for a men's 11 and the fit is perfect so they run true to size, in my case at least. Otherwise, they are a different fit from your usual shoe and require some getting used to. I am a medium width and they are wide through the ball and toe areas on me, but oddly they are not too loose on me--maybe attributable to my high arch. They do not cause any pressure points for me although, initially, I was concerned that they may be uncomfortable where my toes contacted the tips while walking (they do not contact while standing on level ground), however wearing them for several hours while gardening presented no issues at all. Without the strap flipped to the back I have to either grip with my toes or kinda shuffle when I walk otherwise they kind of shift around on my feet, but I adjusted quickly and didn't find this to be and issue either...they're not track cleats after all. They cushion the soles pretty well, although a good pair of flip-flops provide equal comfort. Overall I'm satisfied with them...but not over the moon."

I’ve read some other reviews where people say that the back strap is too short, on the contrary I actually think that the strap is better shorter, as I have Baya clogs that have a longer strap and they’re always sliding down my heel and need to be adjusted all the time. These actually stay put and keep my foot from sliding around.

For the first week they fit perfectly. They were comfortable and had just enough room to slip on easily without being sloppy. Fast forward a few weeks and they have literally shrunk three sizes to the point where I can't wear them. The width has contracted so much that they won't fit my feet and sit askew when I pry my foot into them. It's the oddest thing, one week they fit and the next they have shrunk so much they're almost small enough to hang from my rear view mirror. There must be something in the rubber compound that is not right as I have a hard to believing this is normal.

Will update when they come in. * Update* The size 10 only fits right if I don't use the band for the back. If I put it in the back of my ankle, since the band is shorter than the back edge of the Crocs, it pushes my foot forward and squishes my toes against the front. I'm keeping them to wear without the band, otherwise, you'd have to go up yet another size and then they'd be huge. Very strange but they are very comfortable and much better than the originals.

Because of this, I didn't feel I should rate ""for how long can you wear them comfortably"" and ""do these shoes provide good arch support"".

The clogs are super comfy and are great for any activity including gardening, the beach, pool, around the house, etc.  We love the Crocband because they don't have holes near the bottom of the shoe, so they keep your feet a bit cleaner.  They do run a bit large, but still comfortable to wear.  The shoes can be 100% washed, which is why we keep buying them.  They also last and hold up extremely well.  The customer service is also amazing should you need to use it."

You'll love 'em!,"Once again, Crocs come out ahead of all the other shoes for comfort and stability! They are everything I expect from this brand of shoe, and exactly like the original, well made Crocs. I have the worst feet ever. Name a problem and I'm not enjoying it! Surgery swelled my feet, but didn't correct all the challenges. Shoes hurt and I hated my ugly, messed up feet. Amazingly, Crocs are totally comfortable and cute! I can wear them 24/7, without pain! That's incredible since no other shoe works with my disobedient feet. I wear this pair whenever I want to enjoy fun, lightweight, red shoes! These & my other original type Crocs, are the best ever! I absolutely love wearing them without being reminded that I hate my feet! These Crocs won't disappoint!"

This color - pomegranate - is really cute. I like these a lot but I have to order another pair. I ordered my size and they are a bit too small. We're keeping the other pair for my mother-in-law. If they had half sizes, they would be a perfect fit. I think the next size up will be a bit big but since they are just house shoes, it's okay. Very comfortable. Overall, I really like these!"
Crocs,"Kid's Crocband Clog | Slip On Water Shoe for Toddlers, Boys, Girls | Lightweight",B01HEXF2OE,ROQBO1Y3G6DBU,"August 20, 2017",4,Cute for Crocs... great for chubby toddler feet... fits two sizes,"Size: I like that these shoes last for a long time because of the sizing. With the strap that goes around the back of the foot it fits a size smaller than the marked size (e.g., a size 9 toddler fits like an 8 toddler when using the strap around the back). Using with the strap behind the foot will make the shoe too tight if you actually need the length marked on the shoe. It is a very short strap. Once the strap makes the shoe too tight to wear, I flip the strap forward so it rests on top of the shoe and the shoe lasts though the marked size (so a marked 9 toddler will fit 8T with strap and 9T without the strap). The shoe is very wide and this fits chubby feet that don't fit into other summer shoes (sandals or flip flops). Style: I don't like the look of Crocs, I wouldn't buy any if my child's foot to wear regular summer shoes. These are a slightly more stylish verision of the regular crocs. The colors are great, true to the stock photo. Function: I love that these are easy to clean, easy to put on, great for chubby feet. These are durable, they stand up to toddler abuse. Overall: I love this as my best alternative to traditional summer shoes for my chubby toddler's feet. I love that they are durable and long lasting, but I have bought these for years so I am aware that a 9 is too tight to use strap for a size 9T length foot (so size up if you want to use strap). Photos: You can see both styled with strap on top and behind. The strap is very short. Colors. And red pair is a 8T and using strap as shown has more room to grow. ***please let me know if you found this review helpful by clicking the “helpful” button below. Thank you!!!***"

But we left my sons in sun while at a pool party and when we went to put them back on a couple hours later they were way to small! They were about 2 sizes too small. He had to go home barefoot. I read on a few blogs that if you put them in hot water and put them on your feet and walk around they will stretch back a bit, but I’m not gonna put my 2 year old through that. I did try hot water and pulling at them trying to stretch them out w my hands but no luck. I reached out to the company and their response was just “they tend to shrink in sun and we have no way to fix this”. Not helpful. They wouldn’t even replace them. These shoes aren’t cheap but i keep buying bc my sons feet are so thick and chunky they don’t fit in anything else. I wish company would replace and be more outspoken about the fact that they shrink in the sun. I mean, isn’t the sunny days what these shoes are for? They have holes!!"

Now if you are grown man or women who does not work in the medical field then you shouldn't be wearing Crocs.  If you do, you will be an embarrassment to your family for generations.  If this was 2007, then by all means, wear your Crocs with pride.  I did.  In fact, I wore my Crocs Off-Roads to Machu Picchu AND I hiked to the top of Wayna Pichu wearing those bad boys.

If anything, they are TOO comfortable for him (must be the foam cushion) - he never wants to wear his regular sneakers - which I don't like because although these crocs give his toes more wiggle room, the rubber toe seems to constantly cause him to trip when running outside. Adorable shoes, but since he started school this year, I prefer him to wear these when at the beach or a pool, vs. as an every day shoe he'll be running in on the playground."

Unfortunately, they run small for a size 9. She's 4 years old and a true size 9 in gym shoes. I ordered a 9 in these based on reviews that they run true to size or even a little big... nope! The 9's just fit. I'm hoping they get her through the summer. It's nice they come in whole sizes and not double sizes like some Crocs do. I'll know for next year to size up. Beware that after size 13 the crocband style gets enormous in width for sizes 1 and above. My older son is in a size 2, and I had to return the ones I bought for him. They were so wide that he could almost fit both feet in one shoe! No idea why they make this style so wide after size 13:( We bought him the Electro and Bump It styles which are much more narrow for Crocs anyways;)"
Crocs,"Kid's Crocband Clog | Slip On Water Shoe for Toddlers, Boys, Girls | Lightweight",B01HEXF2OE,R1TB4GP347AKPG,"May 23, 2017",2,Caution - runs small.,"I ordered these for my toddler to wear while we play in the creek this summer. There are two parts to this review. 1.  I ordered them in her current size thinking they would soon be snug with the strap down and then wouldn't slip off in the water. They were WAY too small. Her foot wouldn't even fit in the shoe with the strap up. There was absolute no way of putting it down. I re-ordered them two sizes up from what all her other shoes are. There is a bit a room to grow. But with the strap down they fit perfectly. I should add that when the strap is down it does not meet the heal of the shoe but comes down about half an inch in. They will fit for this summer with the strap down and then still for a while after that with the strap up. 2.  Now that we have a pair that fits, they are wonderful shoes and perfect for what we wanted. She's able to go from the creek to the yard and play comfortably in both places. If the sizing had been more accurate I would have given them a  higher rating."
Crocs,"Kid's Crocband Clog | Slip On Water Shoe for Toddlers, Boys, Girls | Lightweight",B01HEXF2OE,R38TD37BZ74UHM,"February 20, 2018",4,"Great value. Runs a bit small, but the strap does stretch further than you'd think.","My toddler loves his ""dog walking shoes""... these were a great value (our local stores generally sell Crocs for about $30). I noticed a lot of reviews saying they were way too small and that the strap didn't fit, and that's exactly what I thought when I first got them. However, I kind of forced them on the first couple times because my 2 year old isn't coordinated enough to walk in them without the strap, and once they were one his feet he had no complaints about them being tight. And the more he wore them, the better they fit--the strap does seem to stretch out a bit the more they're worn, so definitely don't give up on that aspect. (If the foot bed seems to fit, the strap probably will too if you give it a try). That being said, I ordered an 8 thinking it would be big (he's generally a 7), and the 8 ended up fitting just right."

I believe the wide, firm base was what did the trick.  We have gotten her about 2 pairs per year as she outgrows them.  They get a little worn and scuffed from wear but they have never even gotten close to wearing out ... nor have we ever had any breakage.  She does love to dress them up with jibbitz that I let her pick ... her latest fad is unicorns which are really adorable on these crocs. A great selling feature for me is the ease kids have getting them on and off QUICKLY and with no frustration.  We also go to the beach a lot and they are perfect. ... especially on the hot sand ... another benefit if they get swept out in the water by a wave they float and can be rescued! !!! Crocs are the only sandals we buy for her and they are highly recommended by this grandma."

I bought in a size 4/5 (she wears a 5 now and still has plenty of room).  We've been buying crocs since my son was born who is now 4 and these were the first pair I bought my daughter who is 2.  She is always asking to wear these, I assume because they are so comfortable.  I love them because they are durable shoe that my kids can wear to school as sandals since they are closed toe in the summer, to use as water shoes, and because both kids have to wear Croc's at Montessori as ""indoor"" shoes.  We own several pair in each size.  Can't say enough good things about these.  Highly recommend for toddlers."

These definitely run large but since we bought them for going to the pool and beach and she really likes them, we just are rolling with it and she’ll grow into them. I was surprised how short the back strap is but since they are too big anyway (even with the short strap), we flip the strap up over the toe and let her wear as clogs and she’s happy. Plus at 3 years old it’s nice for her to have shoes she doesn’t need any help getting on and off. Perfect for car rides where she tends to kick off her shoes and these save me the headache of putting laced shoes back on her every time we get out of the car because they just slip on. I won’t let her wear them for lots of walking until she grows into them more but for the pool at our Disney resort vacation and walking around the resort, they were great."

He is currently wearing a 7.5 in the stride rite made to play sneaker and I ordered a size 8 and they fit him perfectly. I ordered a 9 as well just in case we ran into the problem of the heel strap being too short/tight, but it wasn’t an issue at all. We’ve tried a few other water shoes and none of them fit well.

I wanted to try the crocband style. According to the croc site, the crocband style is a 'relaxed' fit (tighter) and the classic are a 'roomy' (roomiest) fit. I normally wear a W2/M4 classic croc and tried a size J3 in the crocband. While it's a tad long, it's a lot wider than the classic. Going down to a J2 probably wouldn't make any difference. Too bad, as I like the style. The sizing of crocs is quite confusing and not accurate. Maybe it's only a problem in the kids' sizes. I have small feet. Maybe it's not a problem for toddler sized ones. The J3 were too sloppy for me."

We ordered a size 7 (during Amazon prime week when they were on sale) and when the first pair came, the tag said ""7"" but the shoe itself was actually a size 6. Mistakes happen, I get it. A replacement was sent immediately. Second pair came and the sizing is correct but the strap that goes around the heel is unbelievably short. No child's foot could comfortably fit with the strap around their heel. I compared it to his other Crocs that we bought at a store and there is a large difference. We had a beach trip coming up in two days and stores here were sold out, so I thought I'd give it one more shot. Amazon wouldn't accept another exchange so I had to return and re-order (meaning I lost the discount I should have had on the shoe). The third pair came and had the same issue with the strap on the shoe. We kept it because we had to have something, but my son could only wear them without the strap which was no fun for me.

I'm one of those awful peeps who made fun of them and thought they were ugly silly shoes.  I'm also an edema sufferer, and because of that have been stuck paying a fortune for my shoes, having to choose brands such as Drew or Emey [sic] for the extra wide width, and increased toe depth.  If you had told me some $25-$30 plastic shoes were gonna solve my issues, I'd have thought you were nuts.  I got these because a friend swore by them, and I decided to prove him wrong by trying them.  Well, the first time I put them on, I noticed the tight instep, and thought well see I am right, but after a few minutes, literally, that loosened up.  The toe depth is perfect, the roomy fit is perfect, and I've been wearing them exclusively for months now!  Well, I did save one pair for Christmas, and to my delight, they fit better than the first pair!  I plan to buy the non-fuzz lined for the warmer months ahead.  I'm blown away really!

Please pay attention.  Not all of us like or can wear foot wear with bumps.

The one thing I noticed immediately when I put this pair on was they felt much harder in the footbed than I remember.  They also seem smaller than my previous size 10s .But this pair has lining which is cozy but may make the fit feel smaller. My Toes are  right at the end and I hope that does not make the ends of my big toes sore. Since the footbed and heel are harder I can really feel the stress in my right ankle and knee. BUT.  I have problem feet. Overall the shoes are nice looking, soft and warm inside and hopefully my feet can adjust to the difference in lack of squishyness. I'll update my review as needed and time to break in."

They are also way too large. I ordered men's 10, and they are 1/2"" to 1"" longer than any other Crocs I have, so I had to send them back for an exchange. The men's 9 are the same length as the Crocs men's 10 Santa Cruz loafers that I bought last year. They're, at least so far, not as comfortable as I would have expected. Nothing drastic. Just don't have that ""Crocs"" feel to them that I have come to expect from Crocs, and I have about 4-5 pair, so obviously, I really like Crocs.."

My kids and I have worn Crocs since their debut in 2002. My daughter wanted fur lined ones for a while. I ordered some in October when the price dropped and saved them for Christmas.   Through the plastic bags it was hard to tell the quality. This morning my daughter was disappointed, and I was highly embarrassed. Both shoes have spots in which the liner is coming out, with the glue visable. In parts the rubbber is deformed or cracked.  In the one picture with both of the shoes you can see the arch on the right one is severely deformed. And I can't even return them! Disappointed considering their price."

Warm, non-skid, easy slip-ons for cold mornings!","I was looking for something fuzzy, warm, and skidproof to slip on when taking the kids to school in the mornings. I only wear Crocs, and usually it's my Athens Crocs flip flops, but my toes freeze in the winter, and I have to put socks on with my Mary Jane Crocs. I read a ton of reviews comparing the various lined Crocs and chose these. And I'm glad I did! I wear a size 11-wide in women's shoes, but wear an 8/10 in my other Crocs because the 9/11 is a little too long. I ordered these in a 10/12 as suggested and they're pretty much perfect, not too big of too small! No, they're not sexy and they look like clown shoes, but they fit well and actually stay on without using the back strap and will save me time in the mornings and not require me to bend over with my bad back to put the strap on. The toe box and bridge is not too snug on my feet that normally require a wide and open top (I've busted the tops of my feet and can't tolerate any pressure or restriction on them.) My only complaint is that the inner left ankle portion felt a little snug, but I think that will fix itself after I've worn them awhile. That's my only reason for a 4, rather than 5-star rating."

When it started to get cold, he complained about the holes in the shoes, so I thought a pair of fuzzy ones would solve that problem. The fuzz is not removable, which I originally thought was a pro; I almost got a pair of knock-offs but noticed it said the lining came out and hesitated. I figured that a removable lining would get bunched up funny with normal wear or somehow otherwise deteriorate, so I chose these with the permanent lining. HOWEVER. I feel now that that was a mistake, lol. After just a few times wearing these, they smell QUITE BAD. My husband does not generally have smelly feet, so I didn't even foresee this being an issue. But the ~slightest~ sweat and these turn into a hotbox for odor. We've been powdering them and he wears socks now to try to keep a layer between his feet and the lining, which helps. 10/10 for comfort/warmth/material, but otherwise, closer to a 5/10 for ease of use just for the trapping of odor."

Well, I just LOVE these.  I usually wear socks that are a tad bit thicker than ""fashion"" socks and my feet never feel like they are being squished and I wear the strap in the front.  When I am sockless, they are a tad big so I put the strap at the back and I am good-to-go.  I even have room in the shoe to add another arch/heel support cushion.  Very happy with these."

Crocs now goes with what they call the ""roomy"" fit which only accommodate big/fat feet and takes away and and all support. The fleece added much needed volume to the shoe so they fit at least reasonable well and makes these usable for moderate cold. I've owned a ""standard"" fit pair of crocs for years which fit my size 9 medium width foot very nicely. I've tried 2 other pairs of new crocs with the ""roomy"" fit which seems to be where crocs is now making all their shoes...returned them all but this pair. Incredibly bad move by crocs as now I am seeking an alternative. Can you say bad designing decisions for corporate greed?"

Crocs,Women's Classic Lined Clog,B0788C71CB,R37Z1J0DAGRCAZ,"September 16, 2018",5,I love the soft lining,"I use these as slippers every day.  I love the soft lining, and they are sturdy enough that if I have to go outside with them, it's okay. If you wear Crocs, you know that the fit is looser than a normal shoe. The top on these is a little tighter than I expected, compared to my previous lined pair that was similar. But I have high arches and instep, so most people probably wouldn't even notice. My previous pair lasted for YEARS of daily wear before the lining finally wore through (so I pulled out the lining and just wear them as ""regular"" Crocs.  They just keep going, and going- LOL!)"
Crocs,Women's Classic Lined Clog,B0788C71CB,R15KMOI9KVHN05,"September 11, 2019",5,Better than Uggs!,"I’m really obsessed with these. I’ve just gotten into Crocs and now I can’t stop. Before this, I only had a pair of the classic crocs. They’re a bit more roomy compared to these fur lined ones. The classic crocs run big, but these are spot on. I’m a women’s 10. These are different than the classic crocs because of the lining and the holes. There are not holes on the lining of the top of the toe as they’re are for the classics. This makes it an awesome shoe for slippers or even to go outside. There are holes on the top, but the lining covers them on the inside. The lining isn’t attached to the top of the shoe so it’s breathable. I love that the trim shows a bit on the outside of the shoe. It does make them more slipper looking than the classic clog, but I’d still wear them in public. I actually think they look more stylish than the regular crocs. Comfort wise they’re just as great as the regular crocs. I wish it had a more of arch support, but it’s not bad enough to reduce a star. I have 4 pairs of Uggs and I would hands down wear these crocs over any of my uggs. I also love that these are the types of shoes that would last for years to come. Long story short, I highly recommend these crocs. I will be buying more in the future. The maroon color is so rich and beautiful."

I still will not wear them going on errands because I don't like the look, but that's my personal preference. However, I would recommend them for their comfort.

I really like that these have a small profile. Compared to the bistro these are less bulky. They have an insole that is fairly thick and provides a lot of cushion. These feel somewhat smaller than the regular crocs, in part because of the closed heel. I’ve had to put them in the dryer to heat them up and stretch the toes out for better comfort. My regular crocs loosened up after some use as well, so I hope that happens with these as well. The nonslip sole works great, I have traction when going from wet ground to a tile floor. They are easily cleaned with a rinse and wipe. These are great shoes for working the floor of the hospital or the restaurant."

I've worn it while taking a walk, worn it while driving, etc. And because it's croc, immersing it in water for cleaning and putting it back on is even more cool.

I have really wide feet and wear 10.5s to 11s so I ordered the 11s. Fit is great on the foot bed, and the heel cup holds my foot in place very well. If you have lower arches its a great shoe. If you have high arches, more specifically, if the top/middle of your foot bulges up, these will be uncomfortable at first. One week in and they have loosened up and formed to my feet. They are sooooo easy to clean. One quick wipe with a dirty rag and they are good as new. The non slip traction is good, and getting better as they break in. Someone once told me to scuff up the bottoms on cement before using. I suggest taking a decent walk on cement so they wear correctly prior to use, either way, they work great."

I like that the soles are removable. These are comfortable like all crocs here's why rated 3 stars they don't breath well.. not that my feet felt over heated butt my feet were sweating pretty badly. However the removable sole is perforated which seems like it wisks away the moisture I would recommend removing the sole after wearing these shoes and allowing them to dry and using a cloth to dry out your shoes and I would probably spray with some kind of deodorizing spray. These also run just a little big. I ordered my true size but I could have gone a size smaller.

The reason they get 4 stars is because they’re actually pretty comfortable (if they fit) they come with removable insules, and are super easy to clean, I have sensitive feet and these have not caused any blisters.

These pop on pretty easily (you need to wiggle your feet side to side to get the heels of these to pop over the back of your foot as you are walking, but that's fine - these are super comfy and well worth the investment.  I have purchased several pairs of Crocs and love them for around the house, but I needed something more robust and watertight for wandering out on the wet grass and wet driveway here in California.  No snow (luckily) but GREAT in the wet fall weather!  I think they look fine with a 'medical clog' type of aesthetic.  VERY HAPPY with these, may order a second pair to have on hand for whenever these finally wear out.  I especially love you can clean them up with soap and water!!  I have pretty hefty feet ""duck feet"" might be appropriate- due to swelling - and these fit nicely.  I typically wear a size 13, but I need xtra-wide width, and these don't crimp my toes, which is a huge BONUS!  UPDATE:  I have fallen IN LOVE with these, wear them just about EVERYWHERE I go!  The most comfortable 'kick around' /casual shoe EVER far superior to ""Tennis Shoes""!  I love them so much I ordered a second pair to have on hand for whenever I wear these out.  They wrap around my big wide feet with room to spare, and I think they look great.  I am a 'fan' of regular crocs, but these are dressier looking.  I'm a heavy guy and with just the stock factory inserts that come with these- I'm comfortable, I normally wear an 'aggressive' arch support to combat plantar's fasciitis - yet these don't cause the plantar's to become inflamed/torn.  I strongly and affirmatively recommend this pair of shoes to one and all - fits as expected I wear a 13E normally (USA) and their 13-Men's fits to perfection with a single pair of cotton socks.  I also wear them with bare feet, no problems.  They 'stay on' your foot!"

The insert that comes in them is super hard and leaves no room for an additional insert, but if you take it out there is only about a half an inch of rubber between your foot and the floor! I compromised and took out the inserts that came with the shoes and put in my own and decided to give them a try at work. I literally walked about 3 feet into my kitchen and realized the ""slip resistant"" soles on these shoes weren't going to work for me. They made a really annoying rubber squeaking sound when I walked as well.. Sending these back and I'll pay a little more for the tried and true shoes from SFC."

More than once, I've paid over $100 for shoes that started falling apart in just a couple of months.  My choice was to step up and get some very expensive shoes or try the Crocs.  I decided to try the Crocs first since they are so inexpensive.  I've been wearing them every day for three months now.  They are crazy comfortable, and not sweaty at all.  They are roomy for my wide feet, and offer surprisingly good support.  The floor in my bakery is textured epoxy that eats through soles, and these are holding up great.  Honestly, I was only hoping for three months out of them.  As inexpensive as they are, I would have been fine with that, but they show no signs of breaking down yet.  Another bonus is how easy they are to clean.  My shoes get covered with flour every day, and these just hose right off no problem.  Give them a try.

The back strap on one of the shoes I received is too short to fit properly over the foot cover if you flip it forward rather than having it behind your heel.  This bothers me as I use these as outdoor shoes and leave the strap up so that I can slide them on and off easily.  I live abroad so it wasn't worth trying to return them.  The other downside is that they have no traction and slip easily on slick/wet surfaces.  I love them though, and use them all the time and would buy more in the future."

I’m on my feet the entire time and these are way better than my regular work shoes. I’m wearing these where ever I go. Also, I do find that they’re a tad loose, but that’s probably because I’m normally a size 7.5 in women’s and I bought the size 8 in womens/6 for mens to give myself a little wiggle room. It’s great they have “sports mode” so I can ensure they never slip but I prefer to leave them off of sports mode because they feel like regular comfy slippers."

They all have adopted the newer hard bottoms. I wanted to find these classic ones because I loved to wear them around the house as indoor slippers. Just for some context, I'm Asian, and we don't wear shoes into the house. Partially to keep the floors clean, but probably some other cultural reason that I haven't looked into yet. We have specific indoor slippers. I haven't looked too much into slippers, but I know these are good in the winter time because they can keep my feet warm and are easy to wash if they start to smell. The only problem I have with these are that it's hard to know what size to buy without trying them on, but that's just me."

So I just knew that I had to replace them. I couldn't even read the size on the bottom they were so worn.

Crocs,Women's Leigh II Adjustable Ankle Strap Wedge Comfort Sandal,B07B8DY325,R2TSVEMA9E3UKX,"June 19, 2018",4,Nice comfy casual wedge!,"I wanted something that gave me some height (I'm 5'9 and love heels!) but still be comfortable. Some times when I go out, I want to wear heels but since I figure it's gonna be a long night, I settle for flats so I don't have hurting feet during the night. I decided on this shoe because the wedge didn't seem that high, I like shoes with ankle/heel straps in this style, and I figured Crocs would be comfy (never really worn Crocs before). I have big and wide feet and usually wear a size 10 so I ordered a size 10. The shoe was a bit snug, but I really liked the style and each step I took was so cushiony! These shoes seemed perfect for a long stroll outside while still being stylish! I ordered a black pair in size 11, and those felt slightly too big and loose, so I returned them and settled for the snug size 10 (buying a black in size 10 though!). I also like how the ankle strap hook system to keep from buckling the shoe constantly! I hate buckling shoes to out them in and off, this shoe is a easy hook! I wore these shoes with a casual dress as I strolled through the French Quarter in NOLA for 8+ hours! And my feet did not hurt! Well, towards the end of the night (or shall I say early morning lol) my feet were a bit fatigued, but I'm sure it was not due to the shoes but do to me walking for a long time! My trek in the Quarter did leave the tan shoes a bit murky but they're easy to clean with a little soap & water and a towel! Overall, I really love the shoe! Though it is slight snug, so I'll take one star off for that, but other than that minor issue, I'm glad I purchased it!"

I've worn them a few times, and they haven't caused me any issues yet with foot pain! I have plantar fasciitis, so that's a huge thing for me. They've been super comfortable every time I've worn them. The strap around the ankle is a bit weird, though. The clasp is there for ankle sizing, not shoe security. After you size the strap to the correct ankle size, you don't need to undo the clasp in order to get the shoe on and off. Instead, the clasp side of the strap slides in and out of a hook on the other side of the strap (Shown in pictures). My only two issues are; 1) that my little toe does pop out the side a bit easy, but as long as you don't have awkwardly small little toes, you're good to go!, and 2) the shoes are a bit slippery due to the material they're made from, so you'll want to either add grippy strips to the bottoms or really scuff them up prior to wear if you'll be on smoother ground such as marble, tile, or linoleum."

The shoes are super cute, very comfortable. The buckle is a little bit strange but it’s actually easier than a normal buckle once you get used to it. My foot is very narrow and so are my ankle so I added extra holes for the buckle. I wear a size 11 so they probably run bigger around the ankles anyway. Definitely recommend the shoe."

I’m a teacher, and I’m on my feet and moving ALL day.  I love wedges because I’m flat footed, and I need the support.  I have this style in tan and black, and I also have a black and white pair, and red.  I’m a little obsessed.  I already have another tan and black pair in a box for when I wear the others out!  The faux hook buckle is the greatest invention ever.  Why didn’t this exist when I was a little girl trying to buckle my black patten leather shoes?  These look fabulous with dresses, a cute pair of shorts, ankle and cropped pants, boyfriend jeans, etc.  Ladies will compliment my shoes, and the first thing I tell them is they’re CROCS! I love their reaction because they think the company only makes clogs.  With the tan color, they do tend to get dirty easily because they’re canvas.  I Scotchguard mine and recently looked up a repair using baking soda, soap, and water to clean them.  They look brand new.  I use a Clorox Wipe on the black canvas and the heel, and they look great once cleaned.  One caution is they aren’t very wide.  This could be a problem if you have a wider foot. You can tell from the pictures that I LOVE CROC WEDGES!"

They're way too wide for my foot. I wear a 7.5/8 so I ordered an 8. All of my shoes are medium widths but I wouldn't say my foot qualifies as a size narrow. The front of my foot slid around so much in these that it was unsafe. Beyond that, on the footbed, there are these little dots. I've seen them on other crocs but never gave too much thought to it. WOW, THEY'RE AWFUL FEELING! I can't stress that enough. It is not comfortable and feels as if it will create blisters on the bottom of my feet. Besides the bumps on the bottom, it's like walking on a big piece of bouncy foam. It's squishy but I doubt it provides any relief from joint stress. There also is ZERO ARCH SUPPORT. At all. They're just squishy but that doesn't equate to arch support. Save your money, move on to something else. --For more Amazon reviews, please follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram--"

That said, they do true to size and are super cute and comfortable. I would try ordering another pair BUT they didn't off me a chance to exchange them. I will have to return them and then buy them again. However - The price is now $20 more expensive. I usually have had very good experiences on Amazon - and I buy a lot of stuff. Not this time.

The soles feel great though. The black ones however,  are much tighter.  I've even tried wearing with socks around the house and using the blow dryer on the fabric while wearing.

I typically wear an 8 - 8.5 but bought a 9 after reading the other reviews. I'm glad I did because the length is absolutely perfect. I would like to mention how thin these are built though. My ft are more ""thin"" than average and I'm still feeling slight discomfort from the edge of the crocs insole on both sides of both feet. I'm hoping that the crocs foam insole wear down a little as I wear them so this is less noticeable and doesn't create blisters.

Crocs,Women's Leigh II Adjustable Ankle Strap Wedge Comfort Sandal,B07B8DY325,R4KXKE9X8X4B,"July 2, 2019",4,Honest Shoe Review,"There are plenty of reviews with lots of differing opinions-too wide, not wide enough, the most comfortable shoe ever, the most painful shoe in the universe. The truth is, no one's feet are the same and there are no guarantee that theses shoes will fit you, but here is my personal, honest review. I hope it helps! I was nervous buying these shoes because my feet hover between wide and not-wide and many reviews said the shoes were narrow. I am a natural 9, so that is what I ordered. However, I managed to get my feet in just fine and went out dancing in these heels the first night I got them. despite some slight rubbing on my big toe, they felt great and I had no complaints. The second time I wore them was walking to work and was a whole different experience. Within a few blocks, the canvas strips were rubbing uncomfortably against my toes and the sides of my feet. By the time I got to my bus, it was very painful. My feet were a bit swollen because I had been standing for hours the day before, so that might have caused some of the discomfort. After some bandages, moleskin placed strategically on inside of the canvas, and Advil, I was able to wear the shoes for the rest of the day. Still, I will be working hard to break them in before wearing these shoes again. One other issue I'd like to make people aware of is the ankle straps- they are pretty small. I have medium sized ankles, but these barely fit me on the last hole. If you have larger ankles, keep that in mind. They might be too small. Overall, I'd say give these shoes a chance. They aren't perfect, but they are pretty comfortable overall. The foam-like sole of the shoe feels great on the bottom of the feet and they are very light. The canvas can rub against the feet pretty painfully, the straps are a little small, and the shoes will likely need to be broken in before wearing them."

I've gotten a few compliments on them, and people were amazed when I told them that they were Crocs! PROS: - Perfect fit! I was a little unsure about buying them initially b/c normally I'm a size 9, but my feet sometimes do better in a wider shoe. They fit great though! No digging into my feet anywhere, no blisters, no chafing. I can't speak for anyone else, but they were a perfect fit for me! (I got a different pair of Crocs sandals in a size 10, and wish I'd asked for a 9 now, lol. Oh well, those are still relatively okay too) - The ('hidden') hook by the buckle makes taking the shoes off & putting them on a breeze! What an awesome idea, I wish all ankle sandals were made that way! I showed someone how it works and they were amazed/jealous! - Designed well! They're very pretty and feminine! (I love that I can wear them with jeans/casual wear AND to dress up!) - Good value for the money! (I've bought more expensive shoes that were not as comfy/made well/nice to look at/easy to walk in) - Oh SO comfy! I could walk around in them all day (and have) and not get sore feet! (If I did, it'd only be from the walking itself, not the shoe) The footbed is squishy, but not too hard or too soft! (For me, anyway) - Pretty good traction on the sole of the sandal! Not that I'd do a lot of running in them/test them out on a slippery surface or anything, but I've had sandals that slipped EVERYwhere I walked - not so with my Crocs! On 'every day surfaces' - great! My ONLY 'critique' (and I'm really stretching here): I wish there was a little more arch support in them. I had to buy additional gel arch supports for them to support my feet (more weight was going on the ball of my feet and heels). HOWEVER - I tend to have high arches ANYway, so this could possibly be an issue with MY feet, and not the sandals themselves. Overall, if you're thinking about buying these sandals, absolutely DO IT. I doubt you'll be disappointed. I plan to enjoy these shoes for as long as possible!"

So I’m planning on bare feet with band aids covering where I might get a blister. I needed something appropriate for the evening before a wedding the next day when I have to wear heels that won’t wreck my feet. Size 6 would be too long but a 5wide (that is not offered) may have been perfect. They are cushy on step and overall feel comfy. The buckle is so clever, thank you, Crocs!

The shoe looked narrow as I first took them out of the box, but my foot easily fit and does not spill over the sides.  The ankle strap has a funky buckle, but easily used and fully adjustable.  There are five holes to adjust strap, and with my sturdy ankles I was on the middle hole.  My ankles are 10 inches around, if that helps.

These sandals are impossibly light, well constructed, and the foot bed is incredibly supportive and comfortable. I’m between size 5 and 6 so I tried both - 6 was a bit too big but 5 was just right. The straps fit snugly on all the right parts of my feet but  do not pinch or rub when I walk. ... literally cannot say enough good things.

Also, whoever came up with the idea of having the slide thing instead of having to buckle them each time ... you are a genius and I love you. I'm glad I read the reviews or I wouldn't have known that you only have to buckle them once, then use the slide thing (that's a very technical term) to put them on after that.

Let me repeat that.  My feet NEVER hurt.  But here's the thing.  These shoes are so ugly.  I hate wearing them.  And they do not breathe at all.  But they allow me to do my job without having to worry about my feet and that is legitimately all I can really ask of a work shoe.

My coworkers also complain of hot feet in the summer and wet feet year round; many of them keep extra shoes at work. They also slip and slide on wet floors. I have none of those problems with these shoes. They’re built like tanks and the non-slip treads are the perfect solution to wet floors in the greenhouse. I’m on my second pair after finally wearing the treads off my first pair with a year and a half of almost daily use. As for shoe size, they tend follow the ski boot rule more than the sneaker rule. You don’t want wiggle room in a ski boot... ever so you get them at your actual foot size instead of the comfortable, roomier sneaker size. Measure your foot and order based on your actual foot size with a little wiggle room. For example, my ski boots are men’s size 8, my crocs are 9, and my sneakers are 10."

Crocs,Bistro Men's and Women's Clog,B0014JGDUC,R277F9ENFD1E0K,"September 12, 2018",5,Fits much more like a normal shoe.,"Crocs fit weird. I normally wear a men's US size 9 or 9.5 in most shoes. With a regular, generic Crocs shoe I wear a Men's 8 Women's 10, and it is roomy. I got the Croc's Bistro in Men's 8 Women's 10 and it fits much more like a normal shoe. I'm happy with the fit as it is a little more snug even with socks, but it is definitely smaller than the normal Crocs model. Overall, it feels less like a big rubber oversized clog and more like a regular shoe. That aside, I love this shoe. The non-slip bottom is really effective, much more so than the normal Crocs. I do not have sweaty feet, so the lack of holes is not an issue for me, even with thick socks— though I can see how this would affect people differently. The nubs on the footbed feel a little less prominent than on the regular Crocs, but it doesn't make much difference. Comfort-wise? 9 out of 10. I do not have any weird foot issues, and I can wear these all day and feel great. There's probably some other shoes on the market that can compare, but these are less than 40 bucks on Amazon, and I'd just as soon replace them a couple times a year than pay over 100 bucks for a single pair of work shoes. Looks-wise? You are wearing rubber clogs. Again, they are a little lower profile than normal Crocs, and the lack of holes makes them even less obnoxious. But I don't wear them for fashion statements. If you need a very slip-resistant waterproof shoe that will protect your toes these are perfect... I wouldn't trust these on ice, but they are perfect for indoor slippery floors. The back strap keeps them reliably on my feet when running up and down stairs. I still have a pair of regular Crocs for around the house and in the garden, but these are great for work. They are a marvel of function over form. The backs near the heel are low, so if you are doing really wet sloppy work all the time your feet might get wet that way... that's the only criticism I can think of for these, and Crocs should look into developing a model for people who do that kind of work."

I buy a pair of these every 3 or so years- typically because someone else takes them from me. They're comfortable and the non-skid tread is incredibly long-lasting. My wife has my pair (that I bought 13 years ago) that she wears every day to work and the tread is still like new- and she wears them both inside and outside every day! They still provide adequate cushioning and are perfect for travel. They're also easy to clean and they don't hold on to smells (that's especially helpful given that your feet will sweat a lot in these). So why 3 stars? Because of the inconsistent sizing. I normally wear a woman's 10.5 in most shoes. For boots and athletic shoes, where I'll often wear a thicker sock and want a looser feel, I'll wear a woman's size 11 or a men's 9.5. All of my previous crocs (in the mule style) have been a size 8 because they tend to be a little large. When purchasing croc loafers, I purchase a size 9/11. I purchased these in a size 8 like I always do and these apparently now fit true to size. I tried on my old 8/10 crocs and they fit loosely and have a little extra space in the back. With the same socks on, I tried on these and they fit exactly with no wiggle room and a firm grip all around my feet. I wish I had bought the 9/11 crocs, but I didn't expect them to suddenly change their fit or sizing. And I hate the hassle of returning shoes and waiting for new ones. UPS isn't anywhere near me, so it's a major hassle. In any case, I'll end up giving these new ones to my wife and I'll wear the old ones, but it's still a hassle. Now beyond my petty gripe about sizing, there's one other downside: there's no side vent in these, so your socks and feet get sweaty very quickly. They make another model with the side vents, but then you sacrifice the non-skid tread. So I'm still waiting for that improvement. It really needs some source of ventilation for people who can't just pull their feet out of their shoes all of the time. All that said, I'll still purchase these again (in a different size) because for the money and quality, they're absolutely worth it. If my family members weren't so eager to ""borrow"" these from me, I'd still be going strong with my first pair."

The only difference I noticed between the local shoes and the Amazon shoes was the country of origin. The online shoes were from China whereas the local pair was made in Mexico. I suggest that you try a pair on at a local retailer (the price will likely be higher)  then compare with your online purchase upon receipt. It's possible that my Crocs from this site were exposed to heat at some point before I received them, or maybe there is a difference with the Chinese version.

Crocs,Bistro Men's and Women's Clog,B0014JGDUC,R32M41WVDWZR37,"February 25, 2015",3,These fit much better than the size 12 pros,"So this is the third pair of Bistro clogs I have bought.  The first pair I bought had vents in the bottom, but they ran reallllllllly large. I know crocs usually run a little big, and I can fit into a size 13 even though for other shoes I wear a 14.  Then when those wore out, I bought the Bistro Pros because I wanted the adjustable strap in the back.  Since the Bistro Vents ran so big, I went down a size and bought the 12s, but they were a little small, a huge difference in size from the vents.  When those wore out I wanted to buy the pros again, but they were no longer available in black on amazon, so I went with these.  Again I went with the 12s, since I would rather them be a little too small than way too big.  These fit much better than the size 12 pros.  Only downside is that the rivet that holds the strap to the back of my heel snapped after 2 days of use.  I'm beginning to think that, while crocs are incredibly comfortable, their quality control is poor, given the enormous inconsistency in size and the ease with which the rivets can break.  However, they are still the most comfortable nonslip shoe I can find for someone who has to be their feet for 8 hours a day and walking 10-12 miles (in the form of circles through a restaurant). I have an email in to Croc to see if they will replace the rivets on this pair.  It has been 2 days, but no response yet."

Previously worn non-slip work shoes were a nightmare of poorly constructed styles that fell apart too soon or were painful to wear, rubbing feet or toes wrong, or just uncomfortable to wear for a long day. Crocs, though, win on all points and my employees have heard me say more than once how much I love them. They are comfortable, even after a 10+ hour day. They can be washed off. They are water-proof. (Oh, whoops, you just dumped something on my shoes or the floor, not a problem for me and my Crocs!) I work in refrigeration and used to wear two pairs of socks. Not any more! Take note, however, that I love this style more than the Bistro Pro Clogs (I didn't like the velcro straps and they weren't as comfortable over a long day.) Take note Crocs:  I will keep buying these as long as you keep making them - don't mess with a good thing!"

Literally like walking on ice. Bought these because ones almost exactly like it I e bought at Walmart just weren't comfy. These were comfortable... When I wore them on carpet. As soon as I walked in a kitchen and behind my bar could barely walk because of how slick it was. I slipped on the smallest amount of water from an ice cube that had melted and threw my back out. Horrible investment and so upset these are marketed as non slip. Thanks Crocs, not only did I waste my money. Now I have to spend extra $ at the chiropractor this week. 4 days before Xmas. Awesome."

These are fantastic They are super comfortable and I never feel like im going to slip out of them when I use the heel strap. I love the addition of the heel strap as without it they feel almost too much like sandals and I don't like that lack of stability while im working.

I have owned crocs in the past as 'shower shoes', and 'camp shoes' and knew exactly what to expect size wise. They 'feel' big in the toe, but they are supposed to. When I got this job a couple months ago, after having not worked a job on my feet for about a decade, I wore my normal shoes to work and within two days my big toes and little toes on both feet had exploded into blisters. Not only that, but being a janitor, i was getting mop water, toilet water, bottom-of-the-garbage-can water and god knows what else on my existing shoes, and they were starting to wreak. So I got these last week. Both problems solved. The soles are also extremely grippy. You don't have to worry about wet floors in these. The only con is that since they have no ventilation holes and they are a solid synthetic they will make your feet sweat if your feet are prone to sweating. Foot powder and thin socks should prevent it from being too big of a deal. So long as they keep making these, and I keep working on my feet, I doubt I will ever purchase a different work shoe."
Crocs,Bistro Men's and Women's Clog,B0014JGDUC,R3T4SPTB8MKOFD,"July 27, 2019",1,Not for Outdoor Use,"Left these crappy hard rubber sandals on my patio for a couple of days after wearing them around the yard.  They warped and are unusable.  Don't leave them in the sun, or you too may need to throw them away.  I regret my purchase."
Crocs,Bistro Men's and Women's Clog,B0014JGDUC,R14GLMTTXYL2DC,"May 9, 2019",4,Decent shoe that performs as described.,"I have to give only four stars because these shoes are not comfortable for extended wear. However, they do not claim to be. They claim to be waterproof and slip-resistant, which they are. Waterproof: They are water proof, which has deflected hot oil and disgusting spilled liquids (read: mop water or chicken juice) away from my feet. If they get really nasty, it is quick and easy to wipe the tops down with a disinfectant wipe. Slip Resistant: The shoes have a great slip resistant sole. I walk fast through our very busy kitchen, around corners, side stepping down the line, into and out of coolers, though freshly mopped floors and  spilled grease and oil. I always feel super stable, able to pretty much stop and start on a dime. The only downside to the slip resistant soles is their grooved design collects a lot of much off of the kitchen floor, with is really hard to get out; I will not walk into my house after work with these on. Fit: They, like most clogs, do run a little large; I wish I could have ordered a half size since I felt sizes 11 and 12 where worlds apart. I normally wear a 12, so that's what I went with after trying on both at home.  Even in my normal size, the 12's are VERY roomy, so I wear them with the strap behind my heel. Even so, it seems my feet have to just slightly flex and engage while walking, to keep the shoes in place. Not a deal breaker, just fatiguing after a long day in the kitchen. The awkward (for me) fit and the lack of cushion are the only problems with this shoe. Cushion: As far a cushioning,even after a relatively short shift of 8 hours, my toes begin to go numb and I get a stabbing pain in my arches around hour 6. Other than the shoes themselves being made out of foam, there is so other cushion. The only support worked into the foot bed design is very subtle curving at the edges of the bed, where it meets the upper and a barely discernible rise near the arch. Since the clog style has an open back, it is more difficult to get an orthotic or  after market cushion to work in these shoes. I use an anti-fatigue mat at work, which helps get me through the shift. Conclusion: I've been using these for about one month now. I am not unhappy with the purchase. I believe that for the price they are good non slip, waterproof kitchen shoes. However, I will be gifting them to another cook and upgrading to something with a heel that can except a more substantial support and cushion insert or possibly a non slip shoe with cushion and support built in."

I have a  heel spur, and until now, the only Crocs that have worked for me were the Sanrah sandal, which I have in 6 colors. They are the only shoes I wear on a daily basis (I live in Hawaii).  The Sanrahs I have are getting a bit worn down at the heel, and it seems that they no longer available in any color but black.  The Serena, like the Sanrah, fits me perfectly, is very comfortable, and I love the style and the melon color. In fact, I like the Serena even better because the ankle strap keeps the my foot from slipping around in the shoe. I plan to buy more of these in the future."

PROS [Sizing]: TTS in length, slightly wider than average [Water activities]: Water resistant, easy to clean, foot won't slide when wet given the ankle strap and grips [Travel]: Extremely lightweight for packing, appropriate for multiple settings (beach, public showers, sightseeing, casual dinner) [Style]: Rubber material is not as obvious as expected [Comfort]: More supportive than flip flops or strappy sandals, pretty good arches [Value]: Best $25 shoes I've purchased in a long time! CONS [Outdoor activities]: Not suitable for hikes like Chacos [Comfort]: My feet will likely be tired after a long day of walking, arches aren't as high as Chacos"

They're comfortable to wear, even for a long day of walking, as they are lightweight and have plenty of cushion. They pack nearly flat in my suitcase, weigh practically nothing, and travel well. They're waterproof, and clean up easily if they get dirty. And they look stylish enough to double as dressy shoes in a pinch. I recieve lots of compliments, and people often stop me to ask what brand they are, and where they can find a pair. Seriously the best! My only tip is to order a full size down - I normally wear an 8.5/9, and the 8 is actually perfect for me. They will stretch out slightly, and can also be heated and stretched as described in other reviews, if the straps are too snug for you."

I tripped twice within the first couple days of wearing them due to either my feet slipping forward or the front of the shoe flapping. It's a strange and insecure feeling so after almost falling down, I changed my gait and curl my toes in slightly while wearing these sandals to avoid slips. I was disappointed to find that the shoe does not hold your feet very well and when on, it feels like you are somewhat barefooted. Maybe it could be because, as some other reviewers mentioned, the sandals are better suited on wide-width feet. Also, the narrow opening makes putting on the shoe a hassle and I'm afraid that I stretch it out with continuous usage."

What I ended up doing is use foot powder to keep my feet fresh and not sweaty. Also the price is reasonable!

I have a narrow foot as well as severe plantar fasciitis.  I had them on for about 1/2 hour before my feet started screaming at me.  I tried a different insert, but that didn't help either.  I really, really wanted these shoes to work - but I know from experience, when my feet aren't happy … sad face."

I brought 10M and I have narrow feet but can get away with wearing size 10. Perhaps I should brought the next size down, My foot slides to the sides and I have ortho inserts that when used without the original inserts squeaks with every step you take-LITERALLY. When I tried to wear them with Crocs original inserts, ortho inserts and ankle socks there isn't enough room for all three. Very poor foot support. A total waste of my money."
Crocs,Women's Neria Pro Ii Clog | Slip-Resistant Work and Nursing Shoe,B0787GJ2Y6,R2B5FMVLBHUNPC,"June 21, 2019",4,Not for feet with super high arches,"My arch was too high. Everything else fit great but the band over my foot. I tried to “stretch out” the top part and foam does t stretch. Ended up making a small cut in the foam to give my foot more space and the entire shoe tore apart. Very disappointed. My foot now had a permanent lump of the top from where the shoe was too tight and deformed my foot. If you have very high arches, avoid these shoes. If you have normal feet they’d be fine. I couldn’t go up any more sizes because then the arch support would be in the wrong place and the shoe would slip off (or better yet, not stay on at all)"

The shoes felt very comfortable....not too loose....not too snug, with a nice toe box. I will admit, the colored pattern was a little funkier than I would normally venture to wear. I am returning the first pair for the black ones with the gray floral pattern. I thought those might also be ""too much."" But that pattern is actually more subtle. I wouldn't feel embarrassed if I forgot to change shoes before heading to the store, LOL.  They fit like Dansko's, but are a heck of a lot lighter! The downside is that I wouldn't be able to tolerate them as a shoe for standing in all day [outside of garden work] b/c they are too hot on the soles for me :( If that isn't an issue for you and you like arch support, these are great. I would like to try a pair that are just the clogs. I purchased a different style that, unfortunately, doesn't work with my feet issues. But, I bet this same style, in clog form, would fit just as well [& I always like extra garden shoes :)]. I have been impressed with how quickly these shoe orders have been getting processed [and how easy the returns have been, so far]. Update: Disappointed, I knocked a star off for size inconsistency. This new pair [same exact model/size] fits tighter across the top. I probably would do fine if I always wore them without socks. But, I a work in the yard through all kinds of weather & I could tell these would bother me. Now, I am conflicted. Do I keep the louder pair after all & return these new ones? And it also makes me wonder how differently the clogs might fit. I miss a good old fashioned shoe store for this :("

Insanely comfortable, easy to hose off to clean, great ventilation on hot Southern days. They stayed outside for me to wear when the next impromptu chore came along. I had them for over a year, wore them constantly when yard duties called each weekend. Lately, I noticed as I placed the shoes on my feet each week that they were getting harder and harder to slide on my feet. I was finally forcing my feet into the toe box just to get them on. I worried that I was retaining water in my feet, possibly a sign of heart issues...turns out, all I needed was a new pair. The shoes, left outside day after day, will slowly shrink. My old and new shoes, side-by-side, show the old to be easily one size smaller than it first was, maybe two sizes. The new shoes, by contrast, are roomy and comfortable. [In the attached photo, the shoe on the left is the ""old"" shoe, the one on the right is the one just delivered, and BOTH are size 11] The moral to the story is to care for your Crocs, don't leave them outside for days on end. Otherwise, they may begin to get snug on you, too."
Crocs,Women's Baya Clog,B01J1LPVWU,R1NRGE55PEQSXB,"June 27, 2017",1,They shrink!!,"Very disappointing!! When first received they were a bit on the large side; roughly one size too big. Unfortunately, I left them right outside the sliding glass door--for the ease of putting on and off when going in and out of the kitchen-- came out this morning only to find out they have shrunk by at least two sizes. When I left them outside yesterday the temperature was approximately 75 degrees and last night it got down to 65 degrees; not excessively hot or cold. This is ridiculous. The whole point of having outdoor clogs is so they can be left outside, especially after working in the yard and they are covered with dirt and mud, Last time I will be purchasing Crocs. Unless you want to wear these indoors, stay away; check out other brands that don't shrink!"
Crocs,Women's Baya Clog,B01J1LPVWU,RY67GO40MKUOQ,"April 3, 2018",3,Genuine Crocs.... Not Well Designed........,"Needed a pair of 'House Clogs', for wearing around the house, cold floors, etc.... I have had similar shoes in the past, though not Crocs, they were similar in design.  did not pay much mind to the design of these, prior to ordering them, however upon their arrival, I noticed that the perforations or air vents along the side of the outside of the shoe, have but a small piece of material in between these 'vents'. Now, it is unclear if it was due to my feet or the way my foot rest inside the footbed, whatever the 'possible reason' I had trouble with the shoe, tearing along these vents. Then upon having seen the design of these and the giant holes, already located near the 'trouble area', in terms of design, and then seeing the very small amount of material used in the constructing of these shoes, in this particular area, I opted to return these shoes, without wearing them. This is a very poor design. Any walking or sudden stops, where force is applied to the outside of the shoe, is likely to result in a tear of these shoes, in this 'noted area' of this particular design. Perhaps, it is due to how my toes are positioned or possibly for some other reason, whatever the case, the fact is, for my specific intended use, these would not be an ideal fit. Placing those vents, right in the bend of the foot, where the toes are not only located, but in which will sustain wear, stretching and or continuous force, is not well conceived, in terms of design. I have owned 'non-Crocs', which have torn in this very place, for this very reason, and the did not have the perforations. Having said this, I would not recommend this product. For some people, this might be an ok shoe, it would perform some task or purposes, w/out any issues, however it is not believed, this to be, a well designed product. Tennis shoes, often tear or come unglued in this same area, for these same reasons, let alone, something which has a foam material, which is less than 1/2"" , holding the shoe together in this very place. I would advise not getting 'any clog' with these vents, positioned in these particular, 'troubled areas'.. However, it is your money, which was at some point, your time, so, spend it as you wish. However, expect to spend more of your time, placing an order for, another set of Clogs, in the near to moderate future, one would assume..."

I think I'm going to like them. Quick easy on and off for outside romps. I'm a size 6 normally but in more expensive shoes I can wear a 7. I ordered a 6 in these and while loose around the foot, my toes touch but not uncomfortably. I would say these are a perfect fit. I love the width as well. I have wide feet so they are perfect. I'll even be able to wear a pair of socks with them if temps are cooler. If you have narrow feet, these probably will not make you happy."

But these are shorter and a lot narrower than the black ones.  Other than the color the only other difference is the black ones I have were made in Mexico and the gray too small ones were made in Vietnam.  Unfortunately I don't think there is a way to tell where the shoes were manufactured prior to ordering them."

Fortunately, the return was free.  I sent them back and ordered in size 8 -- now they fit fine.  They might not be pretty, but they're good shoes for gardening.  If I wear sneakers, the dirt gets in and gets trapped with my feet.  In Crocs, the dirt gets in and falls right back out."

For some reason they are a little tighter than the ones i already have;  both are the same size and style but the ones i have they feel a little wider and they are exactly the same.  If this has some to do with the width (D, in the size selection) it might be the why but the shoe only displays 8-10 and not a letter so how do you know?...who knows!, but they are ok.  They might stretch a little bit. I ordered two pairs and if i'm not pleased the ones i'm wearing i might have to return the other pair but so far i'm eaiting for them to stretch.

I was surprised by the ""Croslite massaging footbed""  since that info didn't appear in the product listing until you click ""more info,"" which I see now after the fact of ordering these.  Don't expect a cozy shoe.  The footbed is not overly annoying and maybe I will learn to like it, but I wasn't expecting a bumpy footbed.  Otherwise they seem well made. I like it that  the strap will rotate to the heal  if I want. Frankly, I am wondering if I could smooth the footbed with sand paper, because I probably wouldn't have bought these had the ""Croslite massaging footbed"" info had not been hidden in the listing.  I'll see how it goes."
Crocs,Women's Baya Clog,B01J1LPVWU,R3TXQ9GSKNSQI,"August 21, 2015",5,Finally bought a pair...LOVE THEM!!!,"I've seen the word ""Crocs"" forever it seems. In fact, chefs and kitchen staff in a series of romance novels set in restaurants wore Crocs. Mario Battali wears Crocs for goodness sake! I'm 73. Female. Overweight by 100 pounds. You'll agree that feet are critical to life and often much abused. Finally ordered a pair for myself. Mens 9, which is actually a tad on the large side, but S.O. comfy!!! Much better than walking on the floor of my cement-slab apartment sock-footed. For this inexpensive price, try them. You'll probably love them too! Addendum: The above review was written in 2015. It is now November 29, 2019, and I'm 77. Today I heard that there is a new ad campaign to encourage the sale of Crocs. It's time to write this: When I moved from New Jersey to South Carolina 4 years ago my crocs came with me. I wore them all the time when home. My daughter would occasionally suggest I shouldn't wear them. I ignored her cautions. They were comfy and I felt trendy wearing them. But there was this one little issue. Not often, but occasionally I'd catch a toe and nearly fall. Not good for someone my age. In June (2019), up early one morning puttering around, lost in thought, I walked across the bare floor and caught my right toe. Catching a croc toe is like slamming on the brakes: your leg stops but the body keeps going. Of course you hardly are aware you're falling until you land. And I fell very hard. Lying on the floor looking at the ceiling, I thought, well, I'm conscious, not dead, nothing broken. I was able to bottom-wiggle across the floor to the carpet, to a chair, where I pulled myself up (I live alone). My left hip and left forearm near the elbow swelled immediately. Less than 2 hours later I went to Urgent Care. It was obvious nothing was broken. Eventually, in slow motion over days, I had bruising that covered my entire cheek left side and turned eggplant purple. Bruising continued down my leg, eventually reaching my foot.  I was very lucky. After the fact, I researched online and found that some other people had written about Crocs. Nurses had also suffered falls and didn't wear them any more. Still quite bruised a month later, I showed my hip to the surgeon who was going to do my knee replacement surgery. He ordered an Xray and there was no problem with the bone. The strike to the hip bone, though it didn't break anything, caused a lump the size of a large grapefruit. Six months later I still have a small lump, perhaps half an egg, on what feels like the head of that hip bone. I can't imagine that Amazon or the Crocs people will let this addendum stand in case anyone actually reads something this old, but you never know. I remember coming back to my original thoughts here that the general love of Crocs in reviews really sold me in 2015. I was never sorry until that horrific fall. Please be careful and forewarned."

They look like toys, but they are durable and perfect for my use.I was concerned that they didn't come in a wide width because I cannot wear normal sneakers unless they are super wide. The toe box might seem too loose on a normal person, but for me they were perfect. If they get muddy, you can just hose them down. It beats ruining a pair of good sneakers. a perfect buy."

These are slightly smaller all around length and width. Not uncomfortable, just firm and not loose as the ""original"" crocs. I am a male, and 11.5 in the originals were larger but that may be because they were designated ""mens"" even though they are unisex shoes. Bottom line, I will buy them again. I like the fact the toes on these are not ""open with holes around the rim"" because where I wear them I get sand and grass + getting into the originals through the front holes. These keep debris out of my shoe a lot better. That fact also makes them a little warmer on the foot - I live in Florida. They look a little more polished like a higher end shoe rather than just a big chunk of plastic. Look over the photos provided on the website. Again, not a deal breaker."

The toe box is much, much wider than the two other pairs of Crocs that I own.  The product description didn’t mention anything about this style being an extra wide width, so I was a little surprised when I opened the box.  But not worth returning.  I’m using them in the house as slippers, and with a pair of thick socks they are the perfect fit. Update:  Wish I would have returned these.  Even with socks they have started giving me blisters.  The button that holds the strap in place also presses uncomfortably against the side of my foot.  I have read that leaving them out in the sun makes them shrink.  I'm going to try that."

Be brave and try it. :-)","Through Amazon Wardrobe I have tried nearly every Crocs style (at least 5 different styles), and of those the SPECIALIST II (both Vent and NON Vent models) and BAYA Crocs are my most favorites. All the different Crocs style may look similar but in fact are different from each other in many ways, using Specialist versus Baya as example: 1. The firmness of the material (some are most definitely softer than others, BAYA is softer than SPECIALIST - neither is ""better,"" just different; I like both in different ways, comfort vs support). I don't know if the company plans it this way, or it's due to manufacturer variation, but there is definitely a difference. 2. The amount of venting (SPECIALIST has none, SPECIALIST VENT has 3 on the side, BAYA has multiple on side and on top). Non venting is hotter to wear, but for example is better if you are wearing for gardening so water and debris don't get inside the shoes. 3. How high the rear of the Crocs rise (SPECIALIST more than BAYA). 4. How thick the sole (SPECIALIST slightly more than BAYA, which is among thinnest of all Crocs). 5. The little tiny knobs on surface of sole that tickle your feet: SPECIALIST more easily felt and firmer than BAYA; neither is horrible especially if you wear socks. 6. How awkward ""ugly Crocs"" like  they look. This may not be important to you but it is for me - this is strictly personal taste/preference. At any rate, the Specialist is the sleekest, most normal looking (non Crocs like) of all the Crocs - just from the way it's built. The Baya comes in second.  BTW I bought Baya in the POOL color for fun and people can't stop commenting on it LOL. Nearly all love its errr ""refreshing"" color tone; kidding aside people love it."

I own a lot of Crocs sandals and I LOVE them, but these I just don't get. They don't have enough arch support for my feet. My big toe rubs on the inside. I REALLY wish Crocs would just give in and make half sizes. We would buy them! Just do it! I'm an 8.5 in women's with narrow feet and I bought both the 8 and 9 to test. The 8 fit more snug at the top of my foot and felt more secure, but my heel was uncomfortably at the edge or if I use the heel strap, my toes were jammed in. So I stuck with the 9 but it's too loose at the top of my foot and the side of my big toe rubs. And I HAVE to wear the heel strap or they'll fall off. I prefer how they look without the strap. So yeah I'm not fully pleased with these. I only paid $15 on cyber Monday so I'm keeping them. I bought them to keep at work (daycare - 10 hour shifts) for when I wear snow boots to travel but need something lighter at work. They work okay. I usually take them off a few times a day to give my big toes a break. I don't understand how doctors and nurses like these for even longer shifts, but I'm glad they work for you!"

These shoes have these poky things that go into your feet.  Maybe to massage them, I don't know.  Nevertheless when I took the shoes off I hurt so bad I could not sleep that night and was in pain most of the next day over my normal pain level.  What surprised me is someone said if you have RA or nerve pain this is the shoe for you.  Well not so in my case.  It was awful.

I returned them and ordered a size 8, and they are PERFECT! So to anyone out there that wears a 9 1/2 tennis shoe, and wants a PERFECT pair of Crocs, order a size 8.

These fit about like the size 10 women's Crocs I had last (wish I could remember the style). Am guessing most people would need to order up a 1/2 size; I have wide feet, so I ordered up a full size and am glad I did. These caused rub spots on each foot where the end of the shoe hits the top of my foot. Fortunately healed quickly. In all other ways, they feel just like Crocs in comfort and support."

They are my summer/beach shoes.  They are very comfortable and I wear them all summer long.  The only downside I think is that they are a little squeaky when they are wet but, they dry pretty quick.  Otherwise, I rock my Crocs no matter what! Side note:  I bought my original pair as a Men's size 10 from a store because I thought they were supposed to be a little big.  This time I went with the recommended size per the Croc's website which is a Men's size 9 and they do fit better.  Your mileage may vary but, I thought this info might be helpful."

I've always been a barefoot kind of girl when I'm at home but over the last few years I've found that my feet hurt at the end of the day without shoes on so my Crocs fit the bill nicely.

I initially thought that I might slip out of them sometime, but after wearing them for a few months, I've concluded that with the right fit, my feet go nowhere. No risk for slipping out. They're also professional. The ability to wash with soap and water allows it to always look clean. I think having the material  made of rubber is key to this and one of the reasons I prefer it to the Dansko's.  Plus, the added height is amazing when you're a short person. Instantly makes you more confident/professional. Comfortable, too!  I've gotten lots of compliments for these shoes. Recommend."

If I spill something on me that’s hot I don’t get wet, and I also don’t feel the heat from it. The only reason why I give it four instead of five stars is because they do make my feet hot because they are completely sealed to be waterproof. However, that is something I’m willing to put aside for all that this shoe offers. They also have memory foam making them comfortable to wear. I have one knee that I’ve popped out of place before, and these shoes are stable enough for my knee. The soles are also removable if you don’t want them or need to replace them. I strongly suggest these shoes no matter what field you are in. I also wear these when it’s rainy or snowy outside of work because they are waterproof and nonslip."

This is a great shoe for a 12 hour shift on your feet! I work in a hospital and wanted something easy and comfy that wouldn't hurt my feet after so many hours. This shoe is perfect. BUT! It's only perfect bc I took the advice of another lady who also wears these in a hospital, she left a review saying they came in small and tight. That's true! But they're RUBBER and stretch! So stick them in the dryer for like 5 mins and put a pair of thick socks on and wear them around the house! They'll stretch easily in a few minutes and be just the right size. Order true to your size. I'm a 7, ordered a 7, they were right, I stretched them, now I wear them every shift I work and they're the most comfortable shoe for what I do. Waterproof and slip resistant too! Oh and in case you're like me and wonder, they do NOT squeek on the floor. But they do squeek from the insole rubbing the inside of the shoe, so I put a dryer sheet between the insole and shoe in both of mine and they don't make a peep. Also light as a feather!

I previously wore sneakers, but found them uncomforatable on days where I had to stand in one place for hours. I considered other clog brands but settled on these. Pros: They are comfortable. The shock absorption is nice and the arch support is nice. I have flat feet, but these work well. Because of the raised heel, they make standing for hours way better. Cons: They are hot! The plastic is not breathable at all. I often times find myself sneaking my foot out of the shoe to cool it. They are also too big. I usually size up to a 10, but a 10 in this size is way too big for my foot. My feet slide in the shoe while I walk which leads to fatigue. Overall I like the shoes and would like to keep them, but i probably wont. I need to buy a smaller size but the shoes are too hot for me to be fully comfortable. I dont like having sweaty feet at the end on my shift. I will probably buy a different brand."

I like these shoes a lot, I gotten them to replace a pair of sub par non-slip sneakers for nursing school that pinched my toes and I really love Crocs in general. I had read about it being tight on the top of the foot which I didn't encounter, so I initially though these are going to be great. The problems started when I realized my feet move a lot in the shoe itself, which means rubbing, which means sore feet and potentially blisters. I wasn't even on the 2nd day of clinicals and it was not happy feet. So I'm think I'll switch the insoles. Same problem, maybe try different socks, it helped but not as much. It could be the wedge or it could be the way I walk, either way, I'm not wearing these for nursing anymore. I would recommend the Bistro Crocs, they're flatter to the ground and have the same non-slip on the bottom, also you can find them for cheaper sometimes. Its a shame, they are really comfy when I'm not moving."

Long hours of standing so good support is a must. Initially, it took a day or two to break in. They were tight across the foot when worn with socks. First night or so I had to remove my socks for them to be comfortable. Now they are comfortable with or without socks. Some sweating is to be expected because of the material but for me it has not been excessive. Wearing with socks also helps to keep sweat to a minimum. I could not tolerate working with sweaty feet. The arch support is excellent. I have plantar fasciitis so that support is a must. I do not need to wear any additional orthotics when I wear these clogs. I was opposed to the concept Crocs (i.e., rubber shoes that are comfortable) but I thought these were cute and they are a lot cheaper then Danskos. I still love Danskos but these work well; too and fit my budget a lot better then Danskos."

However They are very tight across the top of my foot making them VERY uncomfortable. Day 1 was torture and I took them off every second I could. Also anyone suffering from any kind of heel pain... the lift on these is not as high as other brand clog type shoes thus not offering as much relief.

I only recently found that Crocs makes these clogs appproved for nursing, after I just happened to be glancing down one day at work, and noticed the ""flex"" in a co-worker's shoes...I asked what kind they were, and I immediately had to go look them up!  (For a long number of years, I have steered away from clogs, finding I needed more cushion and support than any offered.).  These come in whole sizes, and I usually wear a 9.5 in other shoes, but my regular Crocs are all 9's... So would these fit more like Crocs or like other work clogs??  Not sure about what size to order, I ordered both a 9 and a 10, to return the one that didn't fit.  (I kept the 9's because these really fit more like original Crocs) I'm so happy! There is a LOT of ""Cush"" in the heel, so the 12+ hr shifts walking on concrete floor isn't killing my knees and back.  I usually need a wide shoe; these are comfy because of all the give allowed in the front of the footbed.  I just finished 3-days' concurrent, and I'm still in love!  I've been asked about whether my feet get too hot, but they haven't;  I believe because of the foot movement within the clog, there is enough reciprocal air movement in/out to keep them comfortable.  I also usually need to add an arch support to my right side shoe.  I was pleasantly surprised to find these have very good arch and forefoot support.  I initially was concerned about the snug fit of the padding over the top of the foot, but shortly after they were on, and warmed by the foot, the fit was comfortable. Also, the bottoms are for-real, non-skid, as I can attest to after an episode during one of the shifts this week!!"

Bruises formed on the top of my feet fast. I almost rather have walked barefoot. Ok, maybe not THAT bad, but pretty painful. As soon as I got home, I did what was recommended here by several people. I threw my shoes into the dryer for 5 mins, put on a pair of thick socks, then when the dryer was done, I walked around with the shoes on until they cooled down. That did the trick!

I've owned a number of crocs over the years, and never bought them for the looks. That said, the original Crocs can still be pulled off with a casual outfit and not look too bad. Not these! There is absolutely no style you could pull these off with. However, these are quite possibly the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. The fleece insert makes them fit more snug then regular Crocs, so your foot doesn't flop around. The fleece lining with the soft rubber sole provides a ton of cushion. They are very warm, and I would say perfect to wear as a slipper, but sturdy and comfy enough that you could wear them on a long walk in cold weather. If you are looking for comfort these are the shoes for you. If you're thinking you may be able to pull them off without looking too bad, the answer to that is a hard no."

I've worn them with thick wool socks, thin socks, and no socks and they still fit perfectly.  I love them and they are worth every penny!  Absolutely no regrets about my purchase.  Wish I bought them sooner.  They are very comfortable.  I wear them on cool SoCal mornings with thin socks, but I've also worn them in the snow/ice with thick socks on a road trip (perfect for that, BTW).  They look enough like regular shoes that people don't notice if you have to run into a gas station or convenience store while wearing them, and no holes means they're waterproof so you can wear them outside without getting your socks wet, and clean them easily with a quick rinse if they get dirty.  And, I love that the lining is removable and machine-washable.  They seem to be high quality, well constructed, and very durable, and I expect that they will last a long time.

Crocs,Unisex Classic Blitzen III Clog,B07K97C1M5,RPWEVYCOIE4PP,"November 4, 2018",5,UNDECIDED? ... Get The Scoop!!!,"I have used Crocs for several years now to walk my dog and do things around my property. This style Croc is nicer looking without the holes. The snap style lining is much easier to secure than the button type fasteners. I find the weight, comfort, accurate sizing (order your size if wearing barefoot) and for the most part the quality is comparable. They are generous in width accommodation. What I do notice is the use of a slightly shinier outer sole that does not have traction bite of previous styles. This is a negative because in winter slick conditions it could be problematic. Having said that, I think they are fine for normal wet conditions above freezing. They are easy enough to slip into but not quite as easy right out of the box as previous crocks until your second wearing, not a big deal. In this modest price bracket it remains without question your best option for carefree abuse tolerant kickers . Even if the new outer sole is not quite as durable, it should still outlive the liner. I like that these are nice looking enough to run a quick errand if I am too lazy to put on something more fashionable or expensive. You will not find an easier to clean shoe. Yes, the lining may grab a little lint over time but it is easily removed and a small price to pay for wondering around the neighborhood lawns. I have not had a problem with the liners sliding out when removing my feet. I would suggest using powder if bare footed. You could also use double sided sticky tape to secure the liner down if your feet are hopelessly in love with these Crocs, quite possible. These serve a purpose like no other shoe you own with superb comfort. Hope this review helps your decision.."

The old style had a more slanted shape on the toe box (outside).  This hit my toes, though the length was fine, it was an odd angle, probably to look stylish.  These new ones fit really well, with a rounder shape at the front.  They look just as stylish as the old ones.  I did love those other Blitzen IIs for the ease at going from outside to inside, but they did hurt my toes very slightly.  These new ones have everything the old ones had, except they feel great on my feet.  Only complaint is that the oatmeal color on the navy pair is more like white.  The Blitzen II had a true oatmeal color.  Hoping the white doesn't look too dirty after a while.  Maybe I can change the linings with the old one.

I am just walking around the house wearing them - I don’t even wear them outside! Hence the low stars. That snap should be a lot more durable. Hoping I can return to replace because I really did love them a lot! The insert can be removed to wash - which is what sold me on these slippers. They run small though (cuz of the fluff) I usually wear a size 9.5/10, and I have pretty narrow feet. I got an 11 and they are perfect!"
Crocs,Unisex Classic Blitzen III Clog,B07K97C1M5,R12U7O5O5CI7HC,"November 26, 2019",1,"TOO SMALL, order larger than you need.","I've purchased many pairs of Crocs throughout the years because they are always the most comfortable thing for me to wear at work without killing my feet.  I've never had an issue and absolutely loved every pair that I've bought and worn. First the positives about these shoes.  The color is very bold and throughout the entire shoe, as you would expect from all other Crocs.  The material is high quality including the liner.  The sole is just as slip resistant as the regular Crocs are.  The inserted liner also seems to be a great quality, nice bright color and it's very soft and warm plus easy to remove and wash when needed.  Everything about the material, color and design are absolutely top notch, as I've come to expect from Crocs over the years. The only con / negative that I have about these is that they run WAY too small.  I've purchased the Mens size 11 crocs for years and it's always fit perfectly.  However, these are incredibly small and almost impossible to slip my foot into.  I even tried wearing them without the liner to see if that helped and it does not, the entire shoe is just smaller than normal. I've debated purchasing a new pair one size larger, but I'm worried that will still be too tight and I'll be stuck with two pairs of these that I can't even wear.  Same problem if I order two sizes larger, what if now those are just too big, again I'm stuck with two pairs I can't wear. If the sizing was right, these would have been a 5 star review without question."

I live in Minnesota so it's often cold, wet/snowy and muddy during the holidays. One must take shoes off when visiting relatives homes. You can slip these on and off without finding a chair in a crowded house. You know the drill. Come in take shoes off. Forgot casserole in car, put shoes back on, come back in take shoes off. Wife forgot her purse and is holding cousins baby, put shoes on then take them off. Beer or pop is in the garage or on the snow covered porch put shoes on then take them off on returning. So for that reason alone they are great. Also under pants that look like a decent shoe and are warm, comfortable and water proof. Just stay out of snow drifts. lol"

No arch support,"This is my 3rd pair of lined Crocs (although different styles I guess) and for the first time the linings are a mess.  Are they even made for this shoe? I thought maybe someone switched out the lining with a smaller pair but they have a tag that says they are the correct size.  It is impossible to put them on without the lining flipping up to expose the leather underneath. I have given up trying to re-snap the hidden snap or redo the Velcro. Oddly enough it is worse on my smaller foot, (so it is not a matter of me getting too small a size).  I can barely get the lining to sit correctly in either shoe when I am not wearing them, let alone when I am. But my feet are cold and my other two pairs are no longer fuzzy and warm... just thought I’d spare someone else the annoyance.  Oh and there really is no arch support in this style (I’ve not had this problem with Crocs before)."

I’m an Allen Edmonds guy. 40+ pairs. I bought these online due to a ummmm errrrr ... a ... uhhhh.... Tequila encounter at a freshly opened Taco and Tequila restaurant near my house. The pregnant server at Tempe Taco in Reynoldsburg Ohio was wearing a pair. After I noticed a server was actually wearing what I thought were bedroom slippers (one beer, one margarita, two tequilas )(yes, I Ubered home) when I asked “hey, are you really wearing bedroom slippers at work?” She quickly explained how she was actually wearing Crocs with a liner and they were incredibly comfortable. Soooooo... I whipped out my iPhone and drunkly ordered a pair*. She said “they are a snug fit, go half a size big”. So I did. Then, I promptly forgot I ordered them. Moving forward... more tequila. Three days later I see my security camera  giving me notice of a fresh delivery I have no idea where/why from. Yeah yeah yeah. I know. Here’s the deal. They are perfectly sized. I went up one half size. The liner easily removes for a washing. The shoes are extremely comfortable. I do not have the guts to wear them out of my house but these are the best slippers I have EVER owned. *my girlfriend explained the details to me days later."

Be aware, crocs are changing big time","These are nice fitting and good looking fur clogs. Typical crocs look etc. However, there's a lot changing with the company these days and changing the foot bed is a huge mistake in my opinion.. This time, with this particular shoe, they've made it harder. I mean like walking on cement. I own fifteen or more pairs of different model crocs. Why? In an attempt to find a pair with the comfortable foot beds they used to offer with each shoe.. Even their boots a few years ago were comfortable. Now, they are adding high arches in certain flip flops, hardening foot beds in random others. In other words, it's a guess what you'll get nowadays with the footbed. They absolutely DO NOT specify any type of change they've made for any shoes, flip flops or boots. Size is also slowly shrinking as well so be sure you can send them back when you order them. I completely understand crocs take some ""breaking in"" but these particular ones, they're wayyy different. I mean hard, hard, hard footbed. Worse ones I've seen. The look and feel of the fur is great, again they look great and fur feels good,.. Until you take one step and then you will understand. Especially if you're flat footed."

Crocs are my husband's go-to slip-on shoes for putzing around on our property and for running errands. These crocs only come in whole sizes (hubby wears 9-1/2 shoe), so I crossed my fingers and ordered ""down"" to size 9. Crocs come with a 'back strap' that can be worn around the back of the heel or flipped forward to the front of the shoe to allow for a little extra room. Though my husband usually wears a 9-1/2, he found the shoe to be a little loose; however, with the back-strap wrapped around the back of his heal, they fit perfectly. The tie-dye crocs are true to color (quite bright), very comfortable, and my husband loves them!!"

Regular Crocs kick up sand on the back end and provide scant resistance to evil fire ants. I have used these new shoes two days and while they don't provide the traction of a regular athletic shoe, they are cushiony and keep sand and ants out. I would have preferred a bungee or similar on top, but laces allow me to adjust the fit, looser for walking in the woods, snugger for wearing on errands. I wear them naked; they would be too tight with socks. Best part: I can wash them off after my walk and they're dry the next day. Regular sneakers never dry out in 99% nasty FL humidity, just mildew and smell like something died in your shoes. These were an investment, they are rubber shoes after all, so hopefully they will last a while."

Generally shoes in my size (10) don't look very cute and end up looking more like flippers. I think part of it is the material that the upper portion is made out of have more structure and holds its form better than most shoe upper materials, giving the shoe an appearance incredibly close to the advertised image. There is also something to be admired in the lack of over branding. Yes, it says crocs on the tongue and bottom tread  in roughly size 14 font, but theres no garish logo taking up sides or toe box. These are simply designed to be appreciated for their looks and comfort. As for comfort, 10/10, for sure. I can't speak to arch support because I've never needed it thus far in life (half marathons included), but these are very light weight with a noticeable amount of cushion in the foot-bed.

I have several pairs of crocs footwear including open toe sandals and closed toe shoes. In other shoe brands I am typically an 8.5. But crocs, to my deep chagrin, doesn't do half sizes and I always have to try two sizes and sometimes neither size works for me. I usually go for an 8 in crocs open toe sandals. In their citilane roka I had to go with a 9 (my toes were hitting the front in the 8's). In these the 8's are just about perfect and the 9's are just a touch too long. These are cool shoes. Undoubtedly. If you don't look too closely they could pass for name brand sneakers. They're comfy with that really squishy footbed. They will be my go to for casual outfits."

So I returned and exchanged the item. The second pair I received had the same issue. This time, I measured and studied them carefully. The one that hurts on the top of the foot, right where the laces end, seems to be 1/2 inch less in diameter. The tongue of the left shoe is not properly stitched and cut. The comfortable shoe has the tongue cut out just below the stitches, the shoe that is too tight has fabric left around the tongue. That is pressing on the top of the foot. I would really like to find a pair that fits, I believe these could be good for my feet since the right shoe feels great.  I am attaching pictures in support of my observations. It is difficult to take pictures inside the shoe, where the pressure occurs, so I am trying to use the tip of my finger to show where the good and the defect stitches are. The instep feeling is different where the left shoe allows less flexibility."

They make my size 10+ feet look smaller and that's always a plus for me.  They are a teensy bit snug against my pinky toes and one day when I wore them ALL day, I did get a sore on one toe.  But I find that with Crocs, often this is a temporary thing--they stretch and mold to your feet eventually.  All in all, I wouldn't use them for hard or heavy walking, support isn't there, but for all day errand running, visiting, parties, etc they are great."

But these pinch painfully around the ball of my foot even after that, and the tongue doesn’t tuck into the shoe all the way even with thin no-see-em socks. They’re quite the sweat factory, and rub uncomfortably where the fabric is sewn to the plastic. The soles are way too squishy in the heel-when walking my foot tilts backward.

Left indentions on the top of my foot, and bruised! I bought them for work but through out the day my feet got extremely sweaty and despite how tight they were, my foot slipped around in the shoe! I read reviews that they ‘stretched’ after wear but I couldn’t handle it anymore. They were very sweaty and tight and I had to return them. I normally wear a 7W but ordered an 8 because I do have wide feet. A 9 would have been way too long. The toe box was fine though. They were  very tight around the top where the shoe laces are. Disappointed, wish they offered wide sizes."
Crocs,Women's Literide Pacer Sneaker,B07HHR9Q6H,R19SAVNQWWYR0I,"February 12, 2020",4,Money Well Spent,"I was so excited to see the Literide in a sneaker! The Literide clogs were the ONLY shoe I found that my feet didn’t hurt while working or after, however when I got a new job I wasn’t allowed to wear a shoe that didn’t fully cover my heel. These I’ve found are not quite as cushioned as the clog version but good enough. They don’t have quite as much room in the toe box as the clogs either so there was a small amount of breaking in, in the toe box area for my left foot. My foot  doesn’t tolerate not having  an open toe box  or any shoe that is too snug or grips the wide part of my foot. I feel these have a decent amount of room in the toe box and decent cushioning in the soles to pass for me. That’s why I only gave 4 stars. Also I get off work not limping which is great! As for the looks, I think they look attractive  for being a rubber sneaker & I would give 5 stars on that alone. Never did I ever think I would wear Crocs but I have grown to love them a lot."

There's something amazingly great about crocs designs of spongy, giving soles, great arch support, lightweight footwear and foot ventilation. I just don't get tired of walking in these. One of my heels gets painful when walking a lot in other shoes, even with great arch support like the Merrell MOAB hiking shoe or Merrell Jungle Moc's. These, like another croc shoe I own are just terrific for walking. I always take crocs on vacation now so I can walk for hours. When I do take them off, however, the heel pain comes back. The plastic outside is easy to clean.   My kid's thought I bought black Nike fabric sneakers, like theirs, bec these crocs sneakers look good. I dislike a lot of crocs bec many designs are truly so ugly.  Crocs needs to come up with a footbed insert we can use in other shoe brands."

They are true to size but I luckily I was able to try them on beforehand . And I saved 20.00 by buying on line so I was very pleased. They are super comfortable and I think they go with everything but bought them to wear with my black leggings but think they will look cute with jeans. *** update after wearing them all day for shopping I found them ok, not super comfortable as I was hoping.  So I would say they are a great casual shoe. They are not for running or extended walking, at least for me. I ended up putting in an arch support and they are more comfortable now. I do like them but  just wanted to add this info after wearing them on and off for the past week and if I had bought them at the brick and mortar store I probably would have returned them."

I am a tall girl and though everyone has Danskos they are not comfortable for me- they are stiff and crush my high arches. These are supportive (they could have a wee bit more arch support but..) they are soft and bouncy, and I love that I could literally hose them down and disinfect them if I needed to. I am on my feet for many hours and my feet feel good ( I do wear compression socks) and I feel responsive in them. I am a pretty true 9.5 and it was recommended to size up since they do not have half sizes (I wish they did!) these shoes are on the verge of being a bit too big (I trip up a little sometimes) but I'm getting used to it. Overall, I have worn crocs for work before and I am really glad they are making a sneaker style that looks cool! People have NO idea they are crocs. Overall really happy with them."

He has problems with his feet and I thought this might be a better option for him .... so far, they're working out fine.  I gave them 5 stars as he raves about how much more comfortable they are.

She likes to cook, and spends a lot of time on the kitchen tile floor, and she claims these help ease the fatigue on her feet.  The fluff on the inside makes them warmer for the winter here in Michigan.  The price was ok for what they are, but there is a bit of ""croc tax"" added, since there is nothing else like them on the market.  I have had my crocs for over 5 years, and they are going strong, so the rubber is good for long term longevity if worn around the house on generally smooth surfaces, making them a good value."

This particular set though fits slightly differently  than others, and in my case, makes this croc fit not as well as all others--it is too small: I now figured it out: the white trim/banding around the shoe makes it better for walking in sloshy or wet areas, but it has no perforated holes as the regular crocs have in that area... in my case, it constrains some of my toes more than the regular crocs and so makes it too small to fit with the heel sling in place...so i have to use this pair strictly as clogs without the heel band.

Crocs,Crocband Clog | Comfortable Slip on Casual Water Shoe,B002JCSSQA,R2H771DR2NIL1P,"December 11, 2018",5,Crocs are good for your feet!,Bought my first pair on a lark because they were on sale.  This purchase makes my 5th pair.  I have had several surgeries on my feet and right ankle so Crocs have made the perfect shoe because the toe box is very wide (to accommodate swollen feet) and the shoe bed provide arch support and an inch of solid cushioning.  That cushioning helps people with arthritic knees or bad backs in a way that no house shoe will ever do. *Do not leave your Crocs out in the direct sun or out in freezing temperatures because they will shrink or otherwise deteriorate since they are a rubber-like material.
Crocs,Crocband Clog | Comfortable Slip on Casual Water Shoe,B002JCSSQA,R3N5TTST8XH1EV,"May 3, 2018",4,IMHO (with note about sizing...),"This was my first purchase of a Crocs product, so I didn't know what to expect. I read many reviews to understand why they are so popular, and figured that I would give them a try. One of the reviews that I read indicated that they run small so order one size up--I wear a men's size 11 so I ordered a size 12. The Crocs arrived and were TOO LARGE by approximately one size--I returned them for a men's 11 and the fit is perfect so they run true to size, in my case at least. Otherwise, they are a different fit from your usual shoe and require some getting used to. I am a medium width and they are wide through the ball and toe areas on me, but oddly they are not too loose on me--maybe attributable to my high arch. They do not cause any pressure points for me although, initially, I was concerned that they may be uncomfortable where my toes contacted the tips while walking (they do not contact while standing on level ground), however wearing them for several hours while gardening presented no issues at all. Without the strap flipped to the back I have to either grip with my toes or kinda shuffle when I walk otherwise they kind of shift around on my feet, but I adjusted quickly and didn't find this to be and issue either...they're not track cleats after all. They cushion the soles pretty well, although a good pair of flip-flops provide equal comfort. Overall I'm satisfied with them...but not over the moon."

I’ve read some other reviews where people say that the back strap is too short, on the contrary I actually think that the strap is better shorter, as I have Baya clogs that have a longer strap and they’re always sliding down my heel and need to be adjusted all the time. These actually stay put and keep my foot from sliding around. I love these and plan to order more colors, you can’t beat amazons prices, I got the black and white pair for $19 and they’re $39.99 on the crocs website."

I wear a size 9 all day long and have for years. However I had to get the size 8, so here's what you do. Order your normal size, and then order a size smaller than usual at the same time with the intention of sending one back. That's what I did, and you'll thank me later. The way they are built, one size smaller might work better for you. If I wouldn't of order a size smaller at the same time I wouldn't have know how well they can fit.

For the first week they fit perfectly. They were comfortable and had just enough room to slip on easily without being sloppy. Fast forward a few weeks and they have literally shrunk three sizes to the point where I can't wear them. The width has contracted so much that they won't fit my feet and sit askew when I pry my foot into them. It's the oddest thing, one week they fit and the next they have shrunk so much they're almost small enough to hang from my rear view mirror. There must be something in the rubber compound that is not right as I have a hard to believing this is normal. Anyhow, if you take a chance on this particular style of Croc I would suggest oversizing at least two sizes if this typical."

Fine for gardening and garage work (although it's kind of annoying when dirt gets in through the holes), but I would not walk around in these. My husband loves his, so it really just depends on your fit."

I have a fuzzy navy pair, a camo pair, a royal blue pair, and a green pair.  They are so versatile and comfy!  I hadn't had a pair in this style before so I thought I'd give it a shot.  For some reason, this style fits a whole size smaller than usual.  I usually wear an 11, so I ordered an 11 and it was an entire shoe size too small.  I returned them for a 12, and then they fit like my original 11's did.  Compared to my camo and green pairs, these are less squishy, but I expect them to soften up after some wear."

I ordered two pairs of each in the same size 9 and these were a lot smaller. Had to do a refund and waiting on the next size up to see how they fit. Will update when they come in. * Update* The size 10 only fits right if I don't use the band for the back. If I put it in the back of my ankle, since the band is shorter than the back edge of the Crocs, it pushes my foot forward and squishes my toes against the front. I'm keeping them to wear without the band, otherwise, you'd have to go up yet another size and then they'd be huge. Very strange but they are very comfortable and much better than the originals. Wish they would make the band a little longer."

Now I wear them in place of slippers, too; they stay on better, and I am not prone to trip as I do in slippers that have poor grip. The truth is that I ordered two pairs for my wife, and Amazon's generous return policy let her find just the right size. The color looks sharp, too.

The reason I bought these is that they are definitely cooler to wear in the summer, they slip on and off so easily, and I can wear them for short periods of time without my arches aching.  Because of this, I didn't feel I should rate ""for how long can you wear them comfortably"" and ""do these shoes provide good arch support"".  The first time I tried them on (after receiving them) they felt very comfortable!... I have tried on imitation crocs in several stores and they have never felt comfortable enough for me to buy them. I feel these are definitely worth the cost!"

They are also not as roomy width wise as my other crocs of the same fit.  Cute, hence the 3 stars, but will be returning."

The clogs are super comfy and are great for any activity including gardening, the beach, pool, around the house, etc.  We love the Crocband because they don't have holes near the bottom of the shoe, so they keep your feet a bit cleaner.

Surgery swelled my feet, but didn't correct all the challenges. Shoes hurt and I hated my ugly, messed up feet. Amazingly, Crocs are totally comfortable and cute! I can wear them 24/7, without pain! That's incredible since no other shoe works with my disobedient feet. I wear this pair whenever I want to enjoy fun, lightweight, red shoes! These & my other original type Crocs, are the best ever!

If they had half sizes, they would be a perfect fit. I think the next size up will be a bit big but since they are just house shoes, it's okay. Very comfortable. Overall, I really like these!"
Crocs,"Kid's Crocband Clog | Slip On Water Shoe for Toddlers, Boys, Girls | Lightweight",B01HEXGG0S,ROQBO1Y3G6DBU,"August 20, 2017",4,Cute for Crocs... great for chubby toddler feet... fits two sizes,"Size: I like that these shoes last for a long time because of the sizing. With the strap that goes around the back of the foot it fits a size smaller than the marked size (e.g., a size 9 toddler fits like an 8 toddler when using the strap around the back). Using with the strap behind the foot will make the shoe too tight if you actually need the length marked on the shoe. It is a very short strap. Once the strap makes the shoe too tight to wear, I flip the strap forward so it rests on top of the shoe and the shoe lasts though the marked size (so a marked 9 toddler will fit 8T with strap and 9T without the strap). The shoe is very wide and this fits chubby feet that don't fit into other summer shoes (sandals or flip flops). Style: I don't like the look of Crocs, I wouldn't buy any if my child's foot to wear regular summer shoes. These are a slightly more stylish verision of the regular crocs. The colors are great, true to the stock photo. Function: I love that these are easy to clean, easy to put on, great for chubby feet. These are durable, they stand up to toddler abuse. Overall: I love this as my best alternative to traditional summer shoes for my chubby toddler's feet. I love that they are durable and long lasting, but I have bought these for years so I am aware that a 9 is too tight to use strap for a size 9T length foot (so size up if you want to use strap). Photos: You can see both styled with strap on top and behind. The strap is very short. Colors. And red pair is a 8T and using strap as shown has more room to grow. ***please let me know if you found this review helpful by clicking the “helpful” button below. Thank you!!!***"

But we left my sons in sun while at a pool party and when we went to put them back on a couple hours later they were way to small! They were about 2 sizes too small. He had to go home barefoot. I read on a few blogs that if you put them in hot water and put them on your feet and walk around they will stretch back a bit, but I’m not gonna put my 2 year old through that. I did try hot water and pulling at them trying to stretch them out w my hands but no luck. I reached out to the company and their response was just “they tend to shrink in sun and we have no way to fix this”. Not helpful. They wouldn’t even replace them. These shoes aren’t cheap but i keep buying bc my sons feet are so thick and chunky they don’t fit in anything else. I wish company would replace and be more outspoken about the fact that they shrink in the sun. I mean, isn’t the sunny days what these shoes are for? They have holes!!"

Now if you are grown man or women who does not work in the medical field then you shouldn't be wearing Crocs.  If you do, you will be an embarrassment to your family for generations.  If this was 2007, then by all means, wear your Crocs with pride.  I did.  In fact, I wore my Crocs Off-Roads to Machu Picchu AND I hiked to the top of Wayna Pichu wearing those bad boys.

If anything, they are TOO comfortable for him (must be the foam cushion) - he never wants to wear his regular sneakers - which I don't like because although these crocs give his toes more wiggle room, the rubber toe seems to constantly cause him to trip when running outside. Adorable shoes, but since he started school this year, I prefer him to wear these when at the beach or a pool, vs. as an every day shoe he'll be running in on the playground."

The 9's just fit. I'm hoping they get her through the summer. It's nice they come in whole sizes and not double sizes like some Crocs do. I'll know for next year to size up. Beware that after size 13 the crocband style gets enormous in width for sizes 1 and above. My older son is in a size 2, and I had to return the ones I bought for him. They were so wide that he could almost fit both feet in one shoe! No idea why they make this style so wide after size 13:( We bought him the Electro and Bump It styles which are much more narrow for Crocs anyways;)"

There are two parts to this review. 1.  I ordered them in her current size thinking they would soon be snug with the strap down and then wouldn't slip off in the water. They were WAY too small. Her foot wouldn't even fit in the shoe with the strap up. There was absolute no way of putting it down. I re-ordered them two sizes up from what all her other shoes are. There is a bit a room to grow. But with the strap down they fit perfectly. I should add that when the strap is down it does not meet the heal of the shoe but comes down about half an inch in. They will fit for this summer with the strap down and then still for a while after that with the strap up. 2.  Now that we have a pair that fits, they are wonderful shoes and perfect for what we wanted. She's able to go from the creek to the yard and play comfortably in both places. If the sizing had been more accurate I would have given them a  higher rating."

Runs a bit small, but the strap does stretch further than you'd think.","My toddler loves his ""dog walking shoes""... these were a great value (our local stores generally sell Crocs for about $30). I noticed a lot of reviews saying they were way too small and that the strap didn't fit, and that's exactly what I thought when I first got them. However, I kind of forced them on the first couple times because my 2 year old isn't coordinated enough to walk in them without the strap, and once they were one his feet he had no complaints about them being tight. And the more he wore them, the better they fit--the strap does seem to stretch out a bit the more they're worn, so definitely don't give up on that aspect. (If the foot bed seems to fit, the strap probably will too if you give it a try). That being said, I ordered an 8 thinking it would be big (he's generally a 7), and the 8 ended up fitting just right."

I believe the wide, firm base was what did the trick.  We have gotten her about 2 pairs per year as she outgrows them.  They get a little worn and scuffed from wear but they have never even gotten close to wearing out ... nor have we ever had any breakage.  She does love to dress them up with jibbitz that I let her pick ... her latest fad is unicorns which are really adorable on these crocs. A great selling feature for me is the ease kids have getting them on and off QUICKLY and with no frustration.  We also go to the beach a lot and they are perfect. ... especially on the hot sand ... another benefit if they get swept out in the water by a wave they float and can be rescued! !!!

She is always asking to wear these, I assume because they are so comfortable.  I love them because they are durable shoe that my kids can wear to school as sandals since they are closed toe in the summer, to use as water shoes, and because both kids have to wear Croc's at Montessori as ""indoor"" shoes.  We own several pair in each size.  Can't say enough good things about these.  Highly recommend for toddlers."

These definitely run large but since we bought them for going to the pool and beach and she really likes them, we just are rolling with it and she’ll grow into them. I was surprised how short the back strap is but since they are too big anyway (even with the short strap), we flip the strap up over the toe and let her wear as clogs and she’s happy. Plus at 3 years old it’s nice for her to have shoes she doesn’t need any help getting on and off. Perfect for car rides where she tends to kick off her shoes and these save me the headache of putting laced shoes back on her every time we get out of the car because they just slip on. I won’t let her wear them for lots of walking until she grows into them more but for the pool at our Disney resort vacation and walking around the resort, they were great."

I normally wear a W2/M4 classic croc and tried a size J3 in the crocband. While it's a tad long, it's a lot wider than the classic. Going down to a J2 probably wouldn't make any difference. Too bad, as I like the style. The sizing of crocs is quite confusing and not accurate. Maybe it's only a problem in the kids' sizes. I have small feet.

A replacement was sent immediately. Second pair came and the sizing is correct but the strap that goes around the heel is unbelievably short. No child's foot could comfortably fit with the strap around their heel. I compared it to his other Crocs that we bought at a store and there is a large difference. We had a beach trip coming up in two days and stores here were sold out, so I thought I'd give it one more shot. Amazon wouldn't accept another exchange so I had to return and re-order (meaning I lost the discount I should have had on the shoe). The third pair came and had the same issue with the strap on the shoe. We kept it because we had to have something, but my son could only wear them without the strap which was no fun for me.

Much prefer the look of Crocs shayna mary janes, but these are actually better suited for my purposes with a little more room all around. A great lightweight backpacking camp shoe at 4 1/8oz./shoe (size 8). The extra strap keeps them secure for light water crossings and I can even fit a pair of socks in these if it’s cold. Not pretty, but can be heaven at the end of the trail. My discontinued Shayna’s are good for all the same reasons, but have a little less wiggle room and that streamlined cuteness also comes in at a price of another 2 grams for the pair (4 ¼ oz. each).

HOWEVER ... they make THE BEST camping shoes in the entire universe. I just wouldn't wear them in my everyday life, is all. My husband has the traditional mule/clog style and has sworn by them on our hiking trips. I was looking for something with less material to reduce bulk and weight for ultralight backpacking. This Mary Jane style is perfect, providing the closed-toe protection needed on river and creek crossings at the same time as staying light (8 ounces for the pair). They grip like CRAZY even on semi-slippery rocks, and they're comfortable when it's time to get out of your hiking boots at the end of the day. And yes, the straps *DO* pivot forward in case you need to slide them on mule-style. Someone in Q&A said that they don't. I'm withholding one star because these don't come in half sizes. I usually wear a 7.5 in summer sandals and pumps. The 7 was too small and the 8 is a touch too big ... ladies, you will want to go bigger if you use them for this same purpose that I do. Small shoes bruise toenails. Aside from the minor point deduction for size, I would ABSOLUTELY recommend these for women who hike and camp in the backcountry. Flip flops just cannot compare!"

I have worn out 2 pairs and recently ordered another replacement pair. I was a little concerned when I went to reorder and found out they had changed the original design, but was trying to stay positive - change can be good. As I placed my order, I thought I'd order size 9, because I can be either a 8 or 9. But before I finalized my order I thought I'd be extra careful and just double-check and make sure that is what my other pair was also. Nope. 8. So I changed my order to be a size 8. This extra diligence ended up ironically being no help. When they arrived and I tried them on, they were much more snug than my original pair. I compared them and was surprised to find the new design was almost an inch smaller than my original pair. I'm going to return them and order a 9. Fingers crossed that the size 9 doesn't disappointment more, because this shoe originally had been a perfect summer, camping, sailing, around the house, casual shoe."

Crocs,Women's Karin Clog,B00ZUYN634,R2HHLR1LYXKQLW,"June 14, 2017",5,Crocs Karin are THE BUSINESS for wide feet!,"At first, I panicked because while the shoe was wide enough, my toe was touching the end and I could not decide whether to order the next size up or not! I took my chances, and after one days' wearing, the shoe had molded to my foot and broken in and my toes have plenty of room. I usually wear a 9.5 or a 10 wide in regular shoes, a 8 or a 8 1/2 in men's Adidas, or a 40 or 41 Regular in Birkenstock. I ordered the 10 in the Crocs Karin. It worked out perfectly. I am wearing them in black and navy every day for work and play in the steamy heat of Kentucky and my feet are perfectly supported and nice and cool. Even hiked a two mile trail and went up a rocky creekbed in them in perfect, non-slip comfort. I wore Crocs Malindis for about a decade and this is my new go-to Croc. I hope this style becomes core to the brand; it's relatively attractive (they're Crocs, not Jimmy Choos!), work appropriate for a very casual office, and most of all, well-fitting for a wide foot with a high rigid arch that is usually only suited to Birkenstocks. Thank you, Crocs and Amazon for a great price on a great shoe appropriate for a range of activities."

I am thrilled to be able to get them again as I tried other croc styles and just couldn't find any that I could wear all day, day after day ( my job requires a lot of standing).  These also seem to be more slip resistant than the older model.  In addition, you can wash them under a faucet, dry them with a paper towel, and they look new again.

They were the right length but too tight in the toe box. I show them compared to one of my Crocs brand classic style (Size: Womens 6 / Mens 8). Buying a larger size of the Karins would not solve the problem of the more narrow toe box, they would just be too long. For those for whom regular Crocs are too wide, these would be just right.

The position where the straps are connected caused a little irritation on my instep for the first several times I wore them, which lasted longer than ideal.  I know that Crocs conform to your feet over time, but the irritation was present far too long in my case.  I like the shoes, and I wear them much more often now that they have finally stretched out just enough to release the pressure on my instep, but I docked them a star for all the time I spent waiting for that to happen. Length and width was fine, they fit great - just something about the way the instep is designed, where the straps connect to the body of the shoe, literally rubbed me the wrong way for a while."

Please, excuse the sand","I got these because I need to be able to slip my shoes on and off easily, as I do this frequently and usually with my hands full.  I've heard that Crocs are the most comfortable shoe you can wear  I'm not sure these would provide all day comfort, but they have a little ridge behind the toe line that make it so you don't feel as if you have to squeeze your toe to keep them on as you would with flip-flops.  They have little nubs throughout the instep that might look like you're walking on sandpaper but sort of massage the foot while making them less slippery to wear when they're wet.  The sole of the shoe provides good traction, while the strap is perfect for hanging on Command Hooks   in the entryway!"

The only downfall is being in the sun it soaks up the heat and makes your foot extra hot. Other than that I could be in these all day."

These are super cute, I love the style of them, they don't look bulky other crocs and I would literally wear these with anything..even a summer dress! I actually bought them after finding the exact same style/color crocs on sale for my 2 year old daughter and ordered myself some so we could match. I am also 6 months pregnant and these shoes are so much more comfortable then any of my other shoes and I know they will be a lifesaver as I get further along and my feet start really hurting.

I bought two pairs of these because I loved them so much. I left a pair outside in the grass when I finished mowing and didn't want to track in grass clippings and THEY MELTED IN THE PENNSYLVANIA SUN!!! Now they are twisted and don't fit! I was so mad! Then, like an idiot I left the other pair on my deck and they melted too. Now I have none. They are nice crocs just DON""T EVER LEAVE THEM OUT!!!"
Crocs,Women's Karin Clog,B00ZUYN634,R1NSDDVFUDWG1Z,"June 22, 2018",4,Great for my purposes,"Bought these as camp shoes to rest my feet after a long day of hiking or backpacking, and for light creek crossings to replace my heavy Chacos. Pretty light weight, if that's something you care about. Easy to slip on and off, but also secure and versitile. Have not tried them for light creek-crossings yet, but hope to at some point; I'm not sure they would have good traction for slippery rocks, but the right conditions with trekking poles and they'd be fine. Size was perfect - I didn't size up or down; roomy enough to let toes breathe and even put on thick socks if needed. The footbed isn't super supportive, but I didn't expect them to be. They fit the bill for my specific purposes (lightweight, non-absorbant, resting tired feet in camp), but wouldn't see myself wearing them around town or the house for many hours."

The only thing I will say is that the ones I received were wide, not medium.  That's all right for me, as I have a wider foot, so they fit perfectly.  This cut out the breaking in process I normally get when I buy medium width shoes.  However, for those who don't need the wide width, that's a little deceiving, as the product stated it was medium width.  I just think if you advertise a certain width, that's what should be sent to the consumer.  If the seller has both wide and medium width shoes, then that should be specified in the size selection list.  However, there is no wide option listed at all, so it begs the question why wide width would be sent without ordering first.  Again, that's not a problem for me, but i should think it would cause issues for others."

Nothing gave relief for more than 30 minutes. Then I unearthed an eight year old well-worn pair of purple Mary Janes by Crocs, and in spite of the soles having nearly perished from wear and no longer water proof the relief was instant. The closest Crocs model to my old pair was the women’s Karin Klog and it did not disappoint! The arch support is moderate, but the toe room is ample and the sole is soft and cushion-like. The straps can remain forward so they are easily slipped on and off without bending. On the advice of a few reviewers I went up a size from a women’s 9 to a 10. I can walk again!"

My only complaint is that there aren’t more color choices. I suppose I should mention that these are my first & only pair of crocs. I tried on my aunts classic style crocs out of curiosity- I immediately wanted to move into those shoes and begin new life. A life of simplicity, accessibility, weightless comfort & ergonomics. This is calf socks with sandals. This is Fanny packs. This is no mans land. Are you ready to run with the Wolfpack? Cuz, “ If you ain’t crocin’, you ain’t rockin’.” *Also, these are narrower & more female-foot-flattering than the classic crocs. They’re still quite accommodating to those of us with wide feet. Zero foot fatigue and I’d venture to say that they even add a bounce to my step. I regularly get compliments on them!

The most practical color is black, but I have others in colors or summer prints. The price on these was so reasonable, I bought these  now, to be set aside till I need them. The reality with crocs is the upper part of the shoe won't wear out but as the sole wears down, they become slippery. That is time for a replacement.

I LOVE these platform shoes because I can walk in them and wear them with trendy long skirts and flared pants.  I also love the comfort of crocs, so this is a match made in heaven for me.  The shoes are not frumpy - they are very Euro-hip, BLACK, chunky, and very funky, especially with black clothing, from long tube skirts, to leggings, to ripped skinny jeans and tunic sweaters.  They come with a shiny single black Jibbitz on the top.  These make a STATEMENT, baby.  The black ones are not for the timid.  These feel heavenly on my feet, like walking on stiff black marshmallows.  I keep looking down at them because they are so cute.  I have received LOTS of compliments already. And I don't care what people say about crocs, I always get good comments when I wear them.  My 4 months of right- heel pain practically disappeared within a few minutes of wearing these.  The back straps therapeutically massage the back of my heels when I walk.  It's been almost 1 day so far, I ran errands and walked  the dogs and I am pain free for the first time in a while, which makes me so happy.  I can wear my silicone toe separators in these.  Easy to slip on dark mornings and to take the dogs outside.  I am going to buy a second pair in case crocs discontinues these - I HOPE THEY DON'T!!  JOY JOY JOY!!"

Both the same size, just ""roomy"" vs ""relaxed"". Platforms,  not a fashion statement, just like the idea of 1.5 inches of material between sharp objects & the bottom of my feet. Live in the country and wear Crocs as much as possible. An occasional thorn will penetrate the bottom of regular Crocs. Small price to pay for cool, comfortable feet. Platforms seemed like a great solution. As always, the overall quality was excellent, just the size issue. Give them 4 stars. Unfortunately, 9/11 is the largest they make in the platform design, so mine get returned. If you normally wear a similar style Croc, they should fit.

I mainly wanted to give my review/feedback on the size for other buyers. I’m a true 9 and these fit nearly perfectly. When I say nearly, what I mean is that my heel sometimes hangs out just a teeny bit off the end of the shoe. But, I noticed it fits better when I double check that my foot is ALL the way in. (So far, it seems like if I’m not paying attention, the skin on the top of my foot can get “caught” on the top part of the shoe. But, if I pay attention to get my foot all the way in, it fits perfectly. You might think “just size up” (and for some people, you may want to!) but I want to stay with this size because I don’t want the already chunky shoe to look TOO big. If you’re having trouble deciding between sizes, maybe order both and return the pair that doesn’t work (or, if you’re a Prime member, look into “Prime Wardrobe”). Aside from the size, I’m in my early 20s and I think these look really cute! I got the black version with the white accent and I like how they look with a black top."

I wasn’t sure if I would like the platforms, but as I started walking around in them they were awesome.  I was taller (I’m only 4’7” tall) so I loved that. CON~ My only problem with these crocs is the heel strap.  As you can see in the picture I sent the right strap is a bit larger then the left.  This is only a problem if you want to use the strap in the back.  It’s floppy.  Also the right strap being larger I found to be a tripping hazard as I was walking up the stairs,  the strap caught the next step up and I stumbled.  So for that reason I give them 4 stars.

They are much much tighter from bottom of foot to top of foot. The width is fine but it’s made all wrong. I have had tighter fitting crocs but this is silly. My feet are average size and I don’t know who would wear these things  here’s hoping they make a better fitting platform.

They have the potential to be so comfortable. They're soft and squishy and since they're platform they're even more soft and squishy than normal crocs. However these are made super small. I am pretty solidly a size 7 1/2. I bought the non-platform version of these in a size 8 and my big toe rubs on the end of the toe box and they rub on my instep but they are so soft that I thought I'd try again with a larger size. So when I found the platform version, I ordered a size 9. Should fit right? Well my toe doesn't hit the end of the toe box on these but they still rub my instep. I don't normally buy wide shoes but my feet aren't super narrow either. Normal crocs size 8 are a nice roomy fit on me. I realize these are made to be a  little more ""streamlined"" but unless you have narrow feet, you're going to have issues."

Those are a size 8 womens.  So since everyone was wearing my crocs, I bought another pair, these grey ones, same size, 8, but they fit more like a 7.  They are shorter and the toe box is tighter.  Since the girls feet are 7 1/2, I told them those could be theirs, but I am disappointed that the sizing is different.  Crocs are supposed to fit loosely, so if you are an 8 or 8.5  the size 8 should be correct.  Maybe the grey ones were mislabeled?"

Both fit fine but the brown ones fit best with thin socks if I wear socks. I have diabetes and liver cirrhosis, both of which cause problems with legs and feet, so I need shoes that are very comfortable and not too tight. Crocs really are perfect. I thought the little bumps in the bottom inside would bother me in bare feet but they don't. They are roomy enough that if my feet swell a bit they still fit. They sort of stick to the soles of my feet (even with socks) so there's no rubbing against my sensitive skin. They are also great in the shower. I don't have to worry about slipping, especially when I use hair conditioner or body wash that is slippery, and I can wash my crocs at the same time I wash me. Fantastic!"

I'm a loyal Amazon shopper and am hoping Amazon will take care of this, because either Crocs has a problem with their merchandise quality online - or these were knockoffs!

Crocs,Women's Coast Clog,B01J99JRQU,R14GMI1U6L309A,"May 19, 2018",5,Second pair I've owned.,"So last summer I decided to pull the trigger and try a pair of crocs.  I went with the off-road style because I walk around town a lot and they seemed to have more shoe to wear down. My feet are technically a 9 (men's), leaning more toward a 9 1/2, but I always buy 10 because I like extra toe room.  The off-road style has an adjustable velcro back strap, and I had them dialed in about half way, so I was concerned about buying a 10 in this style since there's no adjustment to be had.  My worries were not necessary, as the 10 fits just as comfortably as I needed it to. And for anyone asking what the difference is between these and the ""Classic Clogs,"" as far as I can tell, the only difference is that the classics have more holes on the toe of the shoe, as these only have two on each side. Very happy with this.  Going to keep using my off-roads for hiking and longer walks, while reserving these for less intensive activities around town."
Crocs,Women's Coast Clog,B01J99JRQU,R3549H2MHMFXBF,"August 6, 2018",3,"Runs narrow and a little short, minimal arch support","I bought these in mint size 9/11. I have one pair of 8/10 classic crocs and a few 9/11 classic crocs. The sizing in general is very inconsistent, even within the same style/size of classic clogs. These however are definitely on the narrow side and thankfully I read reviews before I bought these and went with the bigger size. I wanted the mint color, which is cheaper than the classic, and wanted to try this style with less holes on the front. Also worth mentioning is that the arch is significantly lower than the classic, almost nonexistent, and that may be important to some especially those who buy these because they have foot problems. The lack of arch support is noticeable as soon as you slide your foot in but I've barely walked around in them at all yet so I can't say if they will hurt my feet after standing for long periods. My particular pair was made in Vietnam. Some other reviews had said the ones made in Vietnam were of less comfortable material or one croc was smaller than the other. I didn't have that issue as mine were the same size and seemed to be of similar quality to the made in Mexico ones I have."

They work good in that aspect.  However, they are a bit narrow.  On the croc site they list widths as regular, relaxed and roomy.  For some reason amazon does not include this information consistently and the croc site doesn't even mention the coast variety.  These I would say are ""relaxed"" and because I have circulation issues, I'd rather have ""roomy"".  I will keep these and wear them for short periods of time.

Have had them for a few years and love them but they are waaay too warm to wear in the summer. Unfortunately my flip flops were terrible for walking in wet grass to check the garden. Once they were wet they were wet for most, if not all day and were also slippery to try to walk in. These are my 1st pair of official Crocs and so far I'm loving them. Exactly what I was wanting. Easy to slip on and head out to the yard and slip off when you come in so you aren't tracking dirt/grass/water around the house. I like how you can use the strap if you need it or just swivel it up out of the way if you don't. The grippy texture inside makes it much better walking around if you happen to get water inside the shoe and they dry out fairly quickly. It's great to be able to just rinse them off quick if they get any dirt or grass on them-which is minimal since not much sticks to them either."

I have always given them five stars (except for one pair that the trim is peeling off and I gave it a 4 star for that reason).  However, this one only gets two stars.  There is something wrong with the way this pair fits.  They feel a little bigger than most and the arch doesn't fit in the correct place on my foot even tho they are the same size I always buy.  And for some reason when I wear socks with this pair I always end up with a hole in the heel.  Probably because my foot slides around in them due to the poor fit.  I would think all Croc's would fit the same as long as the size was the same.  But not so with this style.  I don't know if they have changed all Croc's or just this style.  Very disappointed in this pair and a waste of hard earned money.  I will probably buy another pair but if I have this problem again it will be my last Croc's purchase."

This is my first pair & I bought them to leave near the door to throw on when the dog needs to be walked or I take my work dress shoes off and easily cleaned when it's muddy.

So, after hearing testimony after testimony I decided to give these a try. At this price I had nothing to lose. OMG! These do feel like you are walking on clouds. It says on the heel “Dual Croc Comfort”.  I can tell you I have never worn a more comfortable sandal than these. I will say though when walking on a tile floor they tend to squeak. Almost like if you are walking on a wet floor. But, as far as I am concerned I don’t care, that is how comfortable these sandals are. I started wearing them the minute I got them and haven’t stopped yet. No blistering and they didn’t have to be broken in. I have worn them all day and at the end of the day my feet feel great."

The cushiony footbed also has a supportive heel.  I like that the straps are thinner and the flip flop doesn’t look too clunky. I really loved the slender look of the crocs Isabella flip-flops but they were too flat and hurt my feet after awhile. I can wear these out and about and not have any issues. In other shoes, I wear a 6 1/2 to 7 and the size 6 fit perfectly. I tried super feet flip-flops and Birkenstocks but the foot bed was too firm and put too much pressure on my bones.

My toes do not fall off and it is not uncomfortable, but definitely not designed for a wide foot.  I also hoped there would be more arch support, because I have a very high arch.

Really,  what purpose does it serve to change the sizing? 3.)The toe thong and straps are set back further-- leaving an awkward amount of shoe beyond the toes. Looks weird, and pushes the foot back so the heel doesn't sit in the heel cup properly 4.)The capri IV straps had a seam down the middle at the toe thong. The capri V has a sort of crossed strap, with all the stitching bulking up and rubbing the top of one's foot right in that toe strap area-- uncomfortable and can hardly be considered an improvement! 5.) Capri IV had a soft suede like strap-- the capri VI has leather which makes the bulky meeting at the toe thong even more irritating. 6.) The capri IV had stitching where the strap attached to the shoe on the sides-- on the V it appears to only be glued. If you loved your Capri IV's there is a strong possibility that the V will be a terrible disappointment. I am all for change and improvement, but if there is any improvement it must be for Crocs bottom line, because it is certainly not for the loyal customers.  I am extremely disappointed and will not buy Crocs again unless they reissue the IV or rectify the problems with this shoe."

There's a strange ridge in the middle that I couldn't see being comfortable no matter how large I went, but maybe for someone with long, skinny toes? The straps also pinched around my foot, but my foot is slightly wider than average I think. I returned the ones I ordered and won't be ordering a larger size. I'm not rating these flip flops lower because there was a lot of padding in the foot bed that could be comfortable if you can get the fit to work for you.

Crocs,Women's Capri V Flip Flop | Casual Sandal With Extra Soft Footbed and Soft Leather Straps | Lightweight Beach Shoe,B010121QG8,R141RYYZISH9RK,"April 25, 2019",4,"I LOVE THEM !!  However, expect to replace them every year (the reason for the 4, not 5)","They are extremely comfortable.  My feet are a perfect size 6 (8.75"" long)  but I always need size 7 - 8  in full cover SHOES to accommodate my wider toe area in modern shoe styles that tend to taper too much in the toe, pinching my feet. However, with these, a size 6 is PERFECT for me. My foot is exactly 8.75""  long (the foot bed 9.75"" long and the full length of the sole of the shoe is exactly 10.25"" long ) so there's PLENTY of room for my foot length in a size 6. The width of my foot (the trouble spot in shoes) at its widest point (base of toes) is 3.75"" wide.  The upper foot bed is a generous 3.75"" wide and the sole there is 4"" wide.  The heel and center part of the foot bed is 2.5"" wide with a slow taper up to 3.75 (toe base) and then tapers off to a 2.25"" top end. Choose your size based on the FOOT BED measurements because the foot bed is how to judge the fit.  If your foot is any wider than the foot bed, go up a size.  You can get away with slightly longer foot as the upper toe area flattens out the foot bed past the divider (between the ""big"" and second toes) so that the sandal will accommodate a slightly larger foot, but only slightly. These are SO COMFORTABLE and they offer medium arch support for those of us with somewhat higher arches and FORMER Plantar fasciitis sufferers who've been pain free for a long time.  If your arches are unusually high or you currently HAVE Plantar fasciitis,  don't buy these or any other inexpensive sandal, buy a more expensive, higher support arch sandal because you'll need more support than these offer. Take care not to get the upper straps wet or to let water settle in where the upper strap is attached to the foot bed.  The upper straps WILL weaken and stretch out and the glue securing them inside WILL give out.  There's NO fixing them if that happens. The straps/split for the toes DOES stretch out over time and there's nothing you can do about it (to my knowledge) Some have suggested the dishwasher or dryer to shrink them, but that's TOO much water exposure.  Once they get very loose, keep a second pair of shoes in your car just in case they let loose.  They typically DO last for an entire summer, being worn DAILY, and then some, and some will even last two seasons, but once the straps FEEL stretched out and loose, it's just a matter of time. Don't let that dissuade from buying them.  They are REALLY comfortable and very reasonably priced, but they have a life span and you should know that when you purchase.  They are worth the bother, IMHO, and I generally buy a couple pairs a year because I love them so much."

So I splurged and got both these and some much more expensive Vionics to compare. The Crocs were very comfortable, and even reversed the inflammation that was starting to come back from going barefoot. I wore these Crocs every day for about six months without significant pain, until the last couple of weeks of that time period. I assume they were wearing out, since I did wear them all day, every day. The Vionics felt better initially. They have very strong arch support, which at first felt like it was helping. But after a month of wearing them around the house all day, my feet are hurting more and sooner. Also, something about the soles makes my feet stink! Disinfecting them has not helped. It's really bad. So I'm back, to reorder the Crocs. Nice bonus that they cost less than half what the Vionics do! Good luck, fellow sufferers."

They have great arch support, they help absorb sweat at the bottom of your feet so you don't get blisters and they help with foot fatigue.  It drives my podiatrist nuts that these work so well for me!  Highly recommend if you want comfort and style.  I am normally a 7.5 and I can easily wear a 7 in these.

These shoes are not made for m feet, but I imagine they would be perfect for some people. And, a caveat - I realize I have wide feet, but there are almost no flipflops with arch support for wide feet, so I took a chance based on reviews. Sadly, these do not work as I had hoped. I have wide feet with short, chunky toes, a high arch and a high instep. In some shoes I wear a 10, some a 10.5; in a measuring device, my feet measure a 10 E.  I take a Women's 10 in other Crocs and that fits fine. Here is how these shoes fit for me. Length - My toes are a good inch from the end of the shoe, but my heels hang off the end. The foot bed is the right length; unsure if the thong is placed too far back or if my high instep keeps my foot from sitting far enough forward. My guess is a bit of both. Either way, it does not fit right. Width - the thong is situated about so that my toe and inside of my foot falls off the footbed, but the outside of my foot is on it. It seems that the thong placement is a bit too close to the edge, as when I move my foot over, the footbed is wide enough for my foot, I do have a wide chunky big toe, so this might work great for a wide foot with standard or narrow toes. Comfort - They are very comfortable to walk in - not squishy, but very soft.  The toe thong is not comfie for me, but that it likely because of the placement issue. The straps feel fine  - of course, I only wore them for about five minutes. Arch support and location - location is fine, but there isn't much to it, I also tried a New Balance flip flip - now that had arch support! Because I do have high arches, my guess is that this would be fine for someone with flat feet or maybe someone with a moderate arch. Wearing them- these are moderately ""flippy"" when I walk. General - these have a vanilla smell to them; interesting. They are relatively lightweight with a very dense feel to them. I am guessing these are better for moderate to long toes (but just guessing). They would likely work well for C width feet and maybe D, and for a lower arch or flat foot."

Everything else fit great but the band over my foot. I tried to “stretch out” the top part and foam does t stretch. Ended up making a small cut in the foam to give my foot more space and the entire shoe tore apart. Very disappointed. My foot now had a permanent lump of the top from where the shoe was too tight and deformed my foot. If you have very high arches, avoid these shoes. If you have normal feet they’d be fine. I couldn’t go up any more sizes because then the arch support would be in the wrong place and the shoe would slip off (or better yet, not stay on at all)"

The shoes felt very comfortable....not too loose....not too snug, with a nice toe box. I will admit, the colored pattern was a little funkier than I would normally venture to wear. I am returning the first pair for the black ones with the gray floral pattern. I thought those might also be ""too much."" But that pattern is actually more subtle. I wouldn't feel embarrassed if I forgot to change shoes before heading to the store, LOL.  They fit like Dansko's, but are a heck of a lot lighter! The downside is that I wouldn't be able to tolerate them as a shoe for standing in all day [outside of garden work] b/c they are too hot on the soles for me :( If that isn't an issue for you and you like arch support, these are great. I would like to try a pair that are just the clogs. I purchased a different style that, unfortunately, doesn't work with my feet issues. But, I bet this same style, in clog form, would fit just as well [& I always like extra garden shoes :)]. I have been impressed with how quickly these shoe orders have been getting processed [and how easy the returns have been, so far]. Update: Disappointed, I knocked a star off for size inconsistency. This new pair [same exact model/size] fits tighter across the top. I probably would do fine if I always wore them without socks. But, I a work in the yard through all kinds of weather & I could tell these would bother me. Now, I am conflicted. Do I keep the louder pair after all & return these new ones? And it also makes me wonder how differently the clogs might fit. I miss a good old fashioned shoe store for this :("

I’m hesitant to exchange for the next size up as I fear they will be too big. I recently had to return a pair of these to the official store and the girl who works there said it’s because the ones with the band are thinner. Not true. They are not the same length...see pictures...I have the Drew Barrymore’s, they have a band and they fit and I have the regular crocs. Both of these are the same size. So if your current crocs just fit your feet without much extra room I would order a size up. Just wanted to add that when I was packing these up for return I noticed one was shorter than the other. I guess that explains why the left foot was hitting and the right was just about perfect."

I got the blue and grey ones so I think kinda cute! I bought these as house shoes. Honestly I'm embarrassed to wear them around in any other capacity. I originally bought them in a size 7 women's but they were very small so I exchanged them for an 8. My second toe is longer than the rest of my toes and it prevents me from wearing the back strap around my foot but I just use them around the house anyhow so it's not really an issue for my wearing purposes.

I own a few pairs of crocs in this style (that were bought from an actual croc store) and these fit nothing like these. These crocs run ridiculously small compared to my others and are actually extremely uncomfortable to wear. The overall appearance does match the ones I got from the Croc store, except the strap on these do not fit over the top of the croc like they do with authentic crocs. The strap is so small that it actually doesn’t fit over the top of the shoe at all, so it’s sticking awkwardly over the top. Bottom line, I tried wearing these around the house and ended up taking them off within 10-15 mins because they were just that uncomfortable. For $16, I guess if you’re looking for a cheap pair of ‘crocs’, these aren’t the worst out there. I guess it’s true, you get what you pay for."

I thought the first ones were just defective but nope - these are either knock offs or the worst quality croc ever made. The first time I ordered one size up. I wear these in my chicken coop so they stay outside. After two days I noticed they were tight. Two days later they were two sizes too small. I figured they were defective so I returned them. Got a second pair but this time I ordered a size 12 women’s (I wear a size ten women’s normally). These have now shrunk to a size 9. I figured they were shrinking because they are outside where it’s sunny so I kept them in the garage but this week I kept them on the porch and within days they shrunk. My husband also got a pair and the same thing happened. We used to buy crocs for garden shoes and left them outside all the time with no issues. These are horrible and I’d never buy them again.
Crocs,Men's and Women's Crocband Clog | Comfortable Slip on Casual Water Shoe,B07CN8XRZZ,R9UL6DSDXCANQ,"August 7, 2019",5,I avoided Crocs as long as I could,"When I tell you I hate the idea of Crocs, there is no other word to use. I hate them. Not because they are a bad shoe, not because they arent comfortable, no. I hate Crocs because of what they represent. ""Old Man"".. Yup, my kids said I am officially an old man for buying a pair of shoes based purely on comfort and not style. I purchased these for use around the house as well as the campsite. We go camping often, and having footwear that can be easily put on, was a must have. My Daughter who is in a Nursing Class in school wears her Crocs often, and honestly, I believe those in  the Medical field are the only folks that should wear Crocs outside of the home. Yes, I am that guy. I will not leave my bedroom without something on my feet, so having something like Crocs has been quite convenient. Fit.. These things suck to wear without socks. Even with all the holes throughout, they still cause your feet to sweat. The Sweat can lead to foot odor, and it is the foot odor only pigs could appreciate. It is bad. My dogs see me in the Crocs and immediately vomit all over themselves. I think they prefer to smell like vomit than to smell my Feet after a day of bare Croc wear. Wearing them with Socks must be what they are designed for, but if you do this, buy the size bigger than you would normally buy. I wear a 10.5 mens US, so I ordered the size 11 Crocs, and with socks on, the fit it quite snug. Wearable for sure, but not as convenient to slide on as intended. Crocs are comfortable, convenient, and easy to keep clean. They are a great Slipper alternative, and are even Daily wearable. They live up to the hype, and I should have purchased them sooner. I refuse to be the ""Old Man"" my daughters call me, so I will deny owning Crocs, and will only wear them at campsite and during Holloween while wearing a mask."

Sure enough, knockoffs. Ordered size 8, but they fit like 7s. The croc logo isnt centered in the circle on each shoe.

I had another color pair (slate) for about a month before wearing these and enjoyed them both very much.  Until my arches fell.  I can't wear them anymore and need to get help & do exercises to build up my arches.  I had been wearing croc-type shoes for some years, they had some arch support but when I switched to the real crocs, the fun was over.  I love these shoes, very comfy but use with caution.  A friend of mine had same experience with arches falling after long wearing her regular crocs.  The crossband stands out as there are only small holes on top, none on the sides so when wearing, dirt does not get in.  If there was good arch support, I would wear nothing else."

After milling over the decision for a while I purchased two of the Croc Band editions in Charcoal/Ocean & Light Grey/Navy. While I am happy with the shoes themselves, I found the colors to be noticeably different than what I had hoped I would be getting (judging from the photos). I found the Charcoal/Ocean to be a very light grey and not Charcoal as would be the common understanding of the term. Then I also found the Light Grey/Navy to be an off-white color with the navy band being almost black in color. In conclusion, due to the fact that the color variance of the two items I bought, they do not exactly fit into my wardrobe quite like I had planed. Otherwise the comfort & ease afforded by wearing them in ones leisure is true to form."

I picked this model for the color, air holes on top and price.  (I didn't want to spend a lot on a shoe I didn't like.)  These were made in Vietnam. I purchased the size suggested by the Amazon app. (Why, I don't know)  The size is perfect.  My heel is completely within the shoe and I have about an inch clearance in the toes.  There are two items of concern:  first the shoe is narrow.  I don't know if that will cause sores from rubbing.  Time will tell.  I also expected a more ""give"" in the sole for cushioning. I can depress the sole with my fingers so I guess I need to get used to it."

After a few days wear, the Crocs stretched to fit him perfectly. He doesn't like the holes in the top (it allows for dirt to fall into the shoe), but he noted without the air holes, his feet would get really sweaty because the foot bed is also rubber.

My daughter who has Plantar Fasciatis (a very painful foot condition) recommended Crocs to me. So I knew they must be comfortable- right? Well not the first few hours (not for me anyway). They do need a short break-in period to “mold” to your feet & flatten those little raised foot-bed bumps a bit. Since the shoes are made of an extremely lightweight (yet durable) molded “foam” type material they do break-in rather quickly & then are very comfortable. I use mine for yard work, gardening, beach/pool etc - since they are so easy to hose off and clean, while also being cool, comfortable & lightweight on my feet. I highly recommend them. And why not go ahead & get a fun color- because how many other pairs of shoes can or will you ever own in such crazy colors? They’re Crocs - you can get away with crazy in these lol... *Recently at the pool, I had on my Parrot Pink Crocs (that color just happened to be the least expensive at the time - go figure). A small girl wearing the exact same color Crocs as mine walked past us with her mother. Her face lit up as she exclaimed to her mom: “Look mommy! That lady has the same slippers as I do!” We all had to laugh."

Years later here I am wearing crocs. They are everything everyone told me they are and more. So comfy you don't need insoles. The just right squishy yet firm rubber foam lets your paws sink into them just right. They might be a little firm the first wear- but they got better in just a few hours of use. Cleaning them is easy too, being all rubber foam. Good luck getting these things to stink like your sneakers will! I should also mention the inside has little croc teeths that message the bottom of your paws. I thought they might chew me up after a few hours, but nope! I really like them! Easy to take on and off if you put the ankle strap up and out of the way, then these crocs become the most convenient and comfy slippers in the world. I like them soo much I might have to get another pair just for work. I'll let people laugh my shoes, and I'll just laugh at their hurting, sweating, smelly feet, and their ignorance. I even think they look good now! I hate real crocodiles and alligators, I wish we'd hunt them out of existence so it would be safer to swim in Florida maybe. But CROC the SHOE? I love them!"

I have avoided crocs because they are big clown shoes in appearance and I didn't want look like a ...you know.  I finally bought a pair because I am now swimming regularly and needed shoes that could get wet at the pool.  I hate flip flops, which abrade the tender area between big toe and second toe.  Well, I bought the crocs and they are awesome!  Very comfortable.  I have arthritis in my feet and the crocs are surprisingly supportive.  I wear them for long drives.  They are great at the dog park or in the back yard where I am likely to step in something that is very difficult to clean off sneakers but comes off easily with a hose or a wipe from my clogs.  Best of all, I look cool in them, and I know this because the younger generation is impressed.  Not the 20 somethings, who tend to roll their eyes, or my contemporaries who look askance and ask if I have been gardening but the stylesetters of tomorrow.  I wore them to the beach and a toddler and a four year old both patted my shoes. Now I want crocs in every color of the rainbow."

These shoes are light as air and so comfortable. I end up wearing them around the house as slippers to protect my feet from the hard floor and I also wear them when traveling long distances in the car. They are perfect slip on shoes if you're in a rush and just running some errands! Would still never wear these as regular shoes, but they're hilarious and serve their purpose."
Crocs,Classic Clog|Comfortable Slip On Casual Water Shoe,B07DFLMDMJ,R1DERNAWAWRF1T,"May 4, 2019",5,Comfortable and convenient!,"Crocs are a wardrobe STAPLE. Let me explain myself: as a college student and athlete, I need a pair of shoes that I can wear EVERYWHERE. These are perfect for walking around the dorm, showering, walking to class, walking on docks during crew practice, and just being casual. They keep your feet surprisingly warm and are easy to wash off if they get dirty. They are also INDESTRUCTIBLE in the sense that you can do almost anything to them and they will not lose their shape. I would definitely recommend crocs to everyone, from the stay at home moms/dads that need “slip-on” shoes for a quick trip to the grocery store, to the student athlete rowers that want a shoe they can easily rinse a little mud off. (PLUS crocs has colors for EVERY personality)!"
Crocs,Classic Clog|Comfortable Slip On Casual Water Shoe,B07DFLMDMJ,R2FXH6QUEPRYWV,"January 26, 2019",5,Love my new Crocs!,"I've had a pair of Croc knockoffs for at least a decade, and I'd worn them almost completely out. I wore them as slippers around the house, but they occasionally also became gardening clogs, shower shoes, etc. I got a pair of real Crocs to replace them, and the Crocs are definitely an improvement over the knockoffs. First, I love the moveable strap, and my old clogs didn't have one. Whenever I'm up and moving, changing the strap so it's across my heel keeps my Crocs secure without crushing my toes. When I don't need it, changing the strap so it's across the top of my foot means I can easily slip them on and off again as necessary. I can get around easily without the strap, but having the option of using it is great, especially if you're thinking of using them in wet conditions. My new Crocs also have nubs on the footbed, another thing my knockoff clogs didn't have. I wasn't sure if I'd like the texture, but I do. It keeps my foot slightly elevated from the footbed, which means that sweat and moisture dries before my feet feel swampy, something that bothered me about my old clogs and meant I could only wear them with socks. The Crocs I can wear either with socks or without, and it's comfy either way. And those nubs are a nice little massage for my feet, too. When I was shopping for my new Crocs, I noticed there was a lot of reviews that mentioned sizing issues. Maybe because my old clogs were a different brand, I obviously couldn't use them as a size reference, so I just ordered according to my usual shoe size. My Crocs fit perfectly and are super comfortable. There's about a half-inch between my longest toe and the front of the inside space with the heel strap engaged. There's sufficient space around the top and sides of my foot that I can wear thin socks comfortably, but I can only wear thick socks if the heel strap isn't engaged, since that lets my foot slide back enough to accommodate the extra thickness. The Crocs stay on when I'm walking whether the heel strap is engaged or not and whether I'm wearing socks or not. If you're considering getting some Crocs, you really can't go wrong. I didn't really care about what color I got, so I played with the options and ordered the cheapest color for my size, which saved me somewhere between $10 and $25, depending on the color selected. Also something to consider: by ordering on Amazon, I was able to save $14 vs buying directly from the company's website."
Crocs,Classic Clog|Comfortable Slip On Casual Water Shoe,B07DFLMDMJ,RQ2WCC658OFM4,"June 10, 2019",2,Hideous Cheesy Feet,"I got these because someone recommended them for wearing around the house on our hard tile floors. We take off our outdoor shoes inside our home. Anyhow, they are the ugliest pair of shoes I have ever owned. They also make my feet look huge and wide. But that is ok since I got them to wear inside and not many people will see me in them. However, there is another problem. In spite of the holes, they get very hot and are not breathable. If you wear them without socks, your feet will get stinky sweaty. Lastly the arch support is ok, not as good as Birkenstock. The only good thing is they are soft and cushiony which I need walking around in hard tile. But other than that, I think they are no good and don’t understand the popularity. To me they are just overpriced made in china foam shoes. Nothing great. I wish I got a pair of EVA birkenstocks to wear around the house instead. Eva Birks are not as ugly, and have better arch support and nice cushion. Also price wise I think they are about the same. My Husband got the Birkenstock’s and I like his way way better. Also birks are made in Germany (not China like crocs) and they are better quality as a result."
Crocs,Classic Clog|Comfortable Slip On Casual Water Shoe,B07DFLMDMJ,R2FULP0MDD9PI6,"December 23, 2018",5,Comfort,I’m using the shoes as houseshoes because we have all tile and as I’ve aged I’ve developed feet issues from the shoes we wear. I researched the toe shoes and zero drop shoes and since I don’t have access to a store near me Crocs Classics were recommended so I bought these despite some Amazon reviews regarding size difference. Mine came from Vietnam and they fit fine. I recently purchased another pair for the street and the back strap on left foot is slightly shorter than right but after walking a couple of days in them I have gotten use to them. My shoes were made in Bietnam. I think perhaps there are some quality differences depending on where the shoes are manufactured so Cros needs to look at there quality control closer I think. I love the crocs classics and have no foot pain while wearing them.
Crocs,Classic Clog|Comfortable Slip On Casual Water Shoe,B07DFLMDMJ,R3Q4EKC8S61SVZ,"February 14, 2019",5,Great for public showers!,"Pros: Appearance and fit is as advertised. No damage (not crushed/tearing) - holds up well despite sitting in my gym bag underneath stacks of clothes and towels all day, almost every day. Thick enough to not allow water fro shower floor into shoe. Not slippery at all. Good grip Easy to take feet out of shoe to wash feet. I'm able to get each foot sudsy (one at a time) with body wash and put each foot back into the shoe, without slipping. Then, the water from the shower head flows through the holes in the shoe, washing the body wash off of my feet. Sometimes also requires a quick rinse before putting my feet back, but not usually. (No more standing on one foot at a time, trying to wash off that foot while maintaining balance so that I don't fall and die. Yay!) No water buildup in shoes Dry quickly (either by air dry or using paper towel) No squeaky noises WAY better alternative than flip flops!"

I think this was the one they call party pink and its very similar to neon magenta only it has a hint more red to it . crocs are unbeatable for comfort and it has to be the croc brand otherwise it is crap.. the croc brand has a special patent on the material which makes them the most comfortable shoe ever.  I got my spouse a pair and he is the fussiest person alive and he loves them..I ended up getting him another pair he likes them so much.  I have tons of pairs because they are so comfortable and casual.  they are my go to shoes for comfort.  my 16 year old son is horrified that we wear crocs but I love them and I have seen teenage girls wearing them so I think post malone has made them cool ! in my book they always were cool!

These are good.,"I've heard reviews years ago that these might be ugly as sin, but are the most comfortable footwear you can get. As someone who tends to be warm bodied, regular slippers tend to make my feet sweat. Upon seeing the Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale, I decided to give these a try as it might be a cooler alternative. They felt a little weird at first with the bumps inside, but soon after, they were feeling so comfy. They also wear well with socks and the back strap isn't always needed unless you're afraid of them falling off. I don't overheat when working around inside the house or out in the garage with these on, and the choice of colors was pretty nice too (They match my bed). They also are not very loud when walking, meaning you can sneak around decently or just not disturb anyone when you're walking on hardwood floors. I've yet to try these in water, but as a cool alternative to slippers, they're pretty awesome!"

Ordered crocs to wear as ""water shoes"" for the summer.  Boy am I glad I ordered them.  When I quickly started swelling (not even halfway through my pregnancy) these were the only shoes that fit.  All throughout the summer & fall I tried to find other shoes that were a bit more stylish/fall appropriate since these were super bright and summery (jade color is awesome btw, true to the photos).  I never had any luck.  I just wound up wearing these with socks.  With EVERYTHING.  But hey--while every other part of my body was aching day in, day out, guess which part never really bothered me much?  And now they are back to being my summer go-to as a non pregnant individual.  The quality is beyond impressive, still look brand new after at least 7 months of heavy wear on all types of surfaces and some odd months of light wear in addition.  If something should ever happen to these, I will certainly buy another pair because you never know when they will come in handy!"

This time when I ordered new ones of the same size as always before, they are smaller. Size 8 (women's) were always just a tad too large, which was perfect because they stayed on well while giving my feet room to expand when they get swollen. My toes rub the font of the shoe a little in the new ones. By this measurement, I need an 8.5, but that is not offered, at least not in Amazon."
Crocs,Classic Clog|Comfortable Slip On Casual Water Shoe,B07DFLMDMJ,R3QFHYHTJTNFPD,"April 3, 2018",5,The perfect garden shoe,"Crocs are indeed hideous, but they can't be beat for comfort and convenience in the garden. I keep a few sizes on hand in the garage so there can be no excuses when I ask someone in the family to help out! Easy on/off, roomy enough to wear with socks if you need to, and a blast with the garden hose cleans off the muck. I wouldn't wear these ugly shoes out of the house though! One note: I do bristle at the idea of paying more than twenty bucks for rubber shoes, but only the legit “Crocs” provide both comfort and quality. The cheap knockoffs are typically made of hard plastic that hurt, and they start to rip and crack after minimal exposure to the elements. Just fork out the money for the real Crocs, they're worth it."

I am a true to size women’s 9.5. I always get a size 10 on Crocs. I’ve never had classic crocs before, but I’ve heard that these feel a little big on the feet. Since all the crocs I’ve worn have been 10’s, I just got the 10 anyway. When I first put them on, I thought these were going to be too big since I have narrow feet, but once I started walking around in them, they never slipped off my feet with the heel strap. I don’t really use them without the strap. They are roomy and comfortable! I think you should try getting your regular size before thinking of sizing down. See how they fit you personally before deciding to go a full size down."

I bought the crocs because I can't stand the pain from going barefoot all the time. Let me tell you- If I wear these all day, there's no pain or it's largely decreased. They're so comfortable, supportive, light, and handy! I can wear them out to the garden and then just hose them off. They're quiet enough to wear around the house while the kids are sleeping. I have such bad joint stiffness and pain in the morning, it can be hard to get going...but if I put these on right away, I get right to whatever I need to be doing that day! Now I just need a pair for camping and a pair for at work and an indoors pair and an outdoors pair. Lol. LOVE THEM!"

So when my cat chewed the strap on the pair I bought about two years ago, I bought two pairs of these to replace the chewed ones.  I ordered the exact same size as before, but when they came, they were slightly smaller than the old ones.  As far as I can tell, the only difference is that the old pair was made in Vietnam and the new pairs were made in China.  They fit OK with lightweight socks, but not with heavier socks.  Since I couldn't wear them year round here in the midwest, I gave one pair to my niece, who had never heard of Crocs and now has a new favorite shoe."

When you have Cerebral Palsy, dressing is a struggle. I got to a point where I wanted something that I could put on without help, and comfortable with or without socks. Are they kinda ugly? Yeah. But it's worth it. I plan on getting two in black so they can blend in with my pants, but sometimes I enjoy colors. So far I own a Slate Grey and Navy. Both pairs were the right size (I ended up getting Womens 6. A little roomy but not too much, and i have tiny feet) Obviously they're snugger when I wear them with fuzzy socks.  These shoes are also great toe box wise. My heel is very narrow and my foot widens up to my toe box. The toe box is wide enough to where I don't feel squeezed at all, even with thick socks. When I'm travelling and the hotel doesn't have a shower seat I can wear these in the shower since I can't go barefoot. They are very easy to rinse out and dry. Even with my issue with dragging my left big toe, they're pretty sturdy. Most shoes after half a year would already have a hole and need to be replaced. I plan on getting second pairs just to have just in case, but I don't think my left shoes will wear through soon. They're not extremely supportive, I wouldn't recommend them for running, but as someone with chronic pain and weak ankle/foot muscles, these are great for around the house and walking through a bookstore."

The heel area was my biggest concern because I go to the wound care department at the hospital to get my legs wrapped due to lymphedema issues.  And since they wrap my foot, my heel gets uncomfortable after a while in the wrappings.  So the house slippers that I have don't work out for me.  The heel area was fine, but the length was not.  I am in the process of getting them exchange for a smaller size.  The wideness I will have to take care of that on my own.  With the wrappings on my feet, I will have work on the crocs so that they will fit properly."

A feather lite cloud of fairies gently stimulating your feet, bringing comfort and relaxation with their sweet embrace. While a wide toe box gives ample room to stretch your sweet little piggies.

Crocs,Men's and Women's Bayaband Slide Sandal,B07B87JNYS,R1ORZ2VJAJ4X2K,"January 2, 2019",5,Best slides I've ever owned.,"Okay, so first of all, I'm a croc fanatic. These were my third pair of crocs. I've also owned a numerous number of slides, and these are by far the best ones yet. I was expecting these to be a little large since Crocs usually fit that way, but these fit exactly to my size. My feet haven't fallen out of these once, a problem I usually have with slides. Also, they don't seem like they'll break. They have the usual comfort of crocs with the iconic holes. EXTREMELY impressed!"

I got some at a Crocs outlet store long ago that fit well.  I ordered a couple more in the same size online, and they were tiny -- like two sizes small.  I then ordered these Bayaband slides in a larger size and they're too big.  They claim these are ""relaxed fit.""  What the fig does relaxed fit mean in a shoe?  It's not the right size?  So go ahead and roll the dice for your size and place your order!"
Crocs,Men's and Women's Bayaband Slide Sandal,B07B87JNYS,R3HREW6SK9EWVF,"March 2, 2019",5,Very comfortable but I get sweaty feet,"I ordered the size for my regular shoes, and it fit perfectly fine. I wear the slides indoors, and they are very comfortable to walk in. I don't have to ever worry about the slides slipping off my feet. However, my feet seem to get sweaty when I wear these barefoot, so I wear socks to get around this issue. Honestly, all the slides I've worn had this issue, so I think it's probably caused by a combination of the materials used in a lot of the slides and the tendency for my feet to get more sweaty than an average person's feet."
Crocs,Men's and Women's Bayaband Slide Sandal,B07B87JNYS,R1S88BK0NVZGSV,"May 29, 2019",5,Helps with future back issues and cleanup is a breeze!!,"My daughter loved her first Crocs that she had when she was younger. She always wanted another pair. They are comfortable and easily cleaned with soap and water. It is great for people that are used to be barefooted. Since, they tend to develop flat feet and later have complications and issues with back problems. So, I highly recommend this for the house and to help with any flat feet issues that later may arise. Cleanup is a breeze!"

Crocs,Men's and Women's Bayaband Slide Sandal,B07B87JNYS,R1BUOT1OJ2MK06,"April 15, 2019",3,where is the Croc softness?,These are very nice and well made - don't get me wrong - but I remember a year or so ago trying on a Croc  sandal and the bottoms were so soft it was like walking on heaven.  So I decided pay a little extra to buy these for the Croc softness.  They look very nice and the bottoms weren't hard in any way -  but not as soft as I remembered. Just a little bumbed

Crocs,Women's Literide Mesh Lace-up Sneaker,B07DKW75JR,R1CP6UZID0LZLA,"April 4, 2019",5,Day 1: Love these shoes!,"This is the first day that I've worn these shoes and I love them! They look like a sneaker and feel like a Croc. I generally wear a 8 1/2 women's wide. I bought the 8 and it fits better than most shoes. It's very wide, which for me is a big bonus. I don't have to wear a too long shoe, just to get the proper width. I am wearing a medium weight sock and it's just perfect. I generally need decent arch support and these seem to work. I love the black mesh and think they'll make a great summer shoe with a light sock. Great idea for a new line of shoes!"
Crocs,Women's Literide Mesh Lace-up Sneaker,B07DKW75JR,R1FL8A2OPM3ZDB,"April 1, 2019",3,Meh,"I liked that this shoe had the cushion of the crocs foot-bed and that it was a tennis shoe style. They are very light weight. I love crocs because of the relaxed fit on my foot, especially in the toe box. These do NOT have that. The toe box is very small.  I usually don't have a problem with the normal toe box in any shoe, I just prefer the loose/barefoot feel of bigger toe boxes.  I do not have any toe issues such as bunions, but after a full day of walking my pinky toes were throbbing.  The rest of my feet felt great, no plantar issues or arch issues. I guess I'll try them as my zumba shoe and see how they work for that.  I will not use them for walking any distance."
Crocs,Women's Literide Mesh Lace-up Sneaker,B07DKW75JR,R3TQBX1N87P89J,"July 9, 2019",5,Perfect for Travel,"I recently took a big trip overseas and I stressed a lot over what shoes to take. I got a few pairs of shoes that were really expensive and also these. I almost didn't take these with me because I normally don't like tennis shoes, but they were so lightweight that I threw them in the suitcase at the last minute. Thank god for that, because all the fancy shoes hurt my feet and these were the only shoes I had that let me walk all day without foot pain. Highly recommend!"
Crocs,Women's Literide Mesh Lace-up Sneaker,B07DKW75JR,R7C4HPQQ42COS,"August 2, 2019",5,Love how these feel.,"I needed a shoe to walk around in here in Europe. I was having problems trying to find a good shoe here where I live. So I took a gamble on these Crocs. My husband loves Crocs, I just couldn't get behind them ...till now. I bought these and another pair (sandals) so I could have something that wouldn't make my feet hurt while walking around. I bought these for my trip to Bucharest so I could wear with jeans and use when it was raining. These shoes have spared my feet being achy and my knees and hips don't hurt when I wear these. I am a pretty active adult in my early 30's and I can find an awesome running/lifting shoe that gives me support but I always had problems finding that perfect walking shoe-- till these bad boys. Crocs -- you've made me a believer and the shoe is cute! It fits perfectly, looks perfect and I will gladly buy a few more pairs! The perfect shoe to pair with athleisure as well!"
Crocs,Women's Literide Mesh Lace-up Sneaker,B07DKW75JR,R3U85LY5YL3SH9,"May 18, 2019",5,SO comfy,These shoes are so comfy! I bought them for work as I am on my feet all day and they are delightful!
Crocs,Women's Literide Mesh Lace-up Sneaker,B07DKW75JR,R29VIK16SEKB7D,"October 30, 2019",3,No arch support,"These shoes are super cute, which is why I gave them a 3/5, but almost everything else is not great. There's basically no arch support so they aren't great if you're walking for long distances or on your feet for a long time. The back of the shoe is too stiff, so it digs into your heel. Also, I thought they were going to be more of a slip-on shoe. It's not any easier to put them on than a pair of sneakers that you loosely tied. Lastly, the foam bottom kind of snags your sock when you go to put your foot in."
Crocs,Women's Literide Mesh Lace-up Sneaker,B07DKW75JR,R26C7FSRHIV148,"January 5, 2020",5,So comfy,"I love these! You can't tell they're Crocs at all. They're super cute and versatile. Most importantly they're extremely comfortable. I wore these when I went to Disneyland for New Years Eve which ended up being a 16hour day. So, TONS of being on your feet. Typically by the end of a day at Disneyland (which is usually less than half of the time I did on NYE), my feet are aching so badly. But when I wore these, by the end of the night, my feet felt amazing. No pain whatsoever. Even after 16hrs of being on my feet and walking for miles, I still felt like I was walking on clouds. I highly recommend these. Perfect for super intense and long walking days, workouts, or just doing errands."
Crocs,Women's Literide Mesh Lace-up Sneaker,B07DKW75JR,R15T7NSRNMQRJW,"October 5, 2019",5,comfortable tennis shoes,Before ordering the tennis shoes I went to the Crocs outlet in Charlotte North Carolina and tried on the seven it fit tight then I tried on the eight it gave me a little room for thick socks so that’s why I ordered this eight. I usually wear a 7 1/2 in tennis shoes but the 8 fit just perfect. The tennis shoes are very comfortable. I’m thinking about ordering the black ones now. The outlet  has the exact tennis shoe for $65
Crocs,Women's Literide Mesh Lace-up Sneaker,B07DKW75JR,R20GLG05M022K0,"October 22, 2019",5,Very Comfy,I love this shoe! Very comfy! But I had to order a second set because one of my feet is 2 sizes larger than the other.  I wear regular Crocs around the house and they are roomier inside so I don't need another pair of those kind. But these sneakers fit more snug so need a second pair for my bigger foot.

I have to wear super high socks with these or band aids so they don't rub my foot. other than that they're GREAT!!! and somehow they don't get dirty at all. the material is amazing! Great for plantar faciatis too.

I was able to wear them all day at work right out of the box with no blisters or arch problems. I'm on my feet most of the day. Would definitely recommend for walking or standing work.

I purchased them to wear around the house but find myself wearing them everywhere. I bought a wide so I could insert my orthotic insoles and they work great. A great buy for the money.

If I wear them the whole shift (nursing), I get blisters. If I wear them without socks, it works until I get blisters on my heel. Big issue. I can only wear them for a few hours at a time, but when I wear them for under two hours, it's fine and my heels feel great."

I have bad plantar fasciitis and I have to constantly switch shoes all day.  These shoes I bought in March and they are already showing wear and tear in the straps.  Disappointing because they were pretty expensive shoes to fall apart in about a month.  I wish I could find better shoes that hold up longer.  I will end of wearing these until they are unwearable because they help my heels so much."

I have long toes so I have a hard time finding women's flip flops that give my toes the amount of space they need. I would recommend these. They're comfortable which I wasn't sure about the bumps at first. I like that they are easy to wash off and are durable. I tend to sweat in my feet and these don't stink like some of my foam flip flops do.
Crocs,Women's Reviva Flip Flop,B07CN3BDNW,R2RYTGBQ5IIGUR,"May 3, 2019",5,No breaking in these sandals!,"These sandals are just as comfortable as they look and right from the start, no breaking them in. I usually don't buy any shoe online because I have a wide foot. They fit me no problem and are so comfy and cushion-y. They look so summer-y too, especially the light blue. Ordering and delivery were great ..no problems at all."

I'm a nurse and after a 12 hour shift, getting out of my tennis shoes and into these sandals is wonderful. I've never considered wearing the crocs clogs and won't but the sandals feel terrific on tired feet."
Crocs,Women's Reviva Flip Flop,B07CN3BDNW,R3KVG3JZ5TRR61,"July 12, 2019",3,Disappointed,"I haven’t worn these a lot yet but they are comfortable. The one thing I am disappointed in is the straps. Crocs usually have a thick rubbery strap but these have a thin strap made of some material that I’m not sure will last very long. I have had my other crocs for about 5 years and they are not worn out. They are my go to shoes for going outside during the summer so I wear them every day. I am taking my new crocs to the beach in a few weeks and I hope they hold up. Crocs, you need to rethink the flimsy straps on these particular flip flops, especially for how much they cost."

Crocs,Women's Reviva Flip Flop,B07CN3BDNW,R2GVUBT3G37URN,"June 6, 2019",1,Falling apart,I’ve had these flip flops less than 2 months and they are literally falling apart. Very poor quality. I expect more from crocs.
Crocs,Women's Reviva Flip Flop,B07CN3BDNW,R38TDE37EBV8Z3,"January 23, 2020",5,Wonderful for plantar fasciitis and associated back pain!,"When my spouse was in the hospital following multiple strokes, I got a pair of these sandals because I needed something that would cushion my feet while I was standing or pacing for many hours daily. I also needed something I could slip on to run and pee if I woke up in the middle of the night, as I was sleeping in the hospital. After doing it once, I didn't want to have to run across a hospital room floor barefoot ever again. These helped my plantar fasciitis pain and associated back pain SO MUCH. After being my primary footwear at home for 8 months, my spouse recently noticed that my heels were sunken in. Suddenly, it made sense that I have been having a lot more back pain and can't stand up barefoot without being in agony. So I went to order another pair. For whatever reason, the black and gray version is half price in my size right now. I love these enough that I ordered two pairs. I didn't even realize just how awesome they'd been until they were too broken down and suddenly stopped helping me. Also, for me, they took ZERO breaking in, which is freaking amazing."

Crocs,Women's Reviva Flip Flop,B07CN3BDNW,RXXI9WYJBBRRX,"January 15, 2020",5,A MUST BUY IF YOU STAND ON YOUR FEET ALL DAY,"I was not too sure these would be the answer but I gave them a shot and they are amazing! The foam bubbles in the foot bed really cushion your feet and my heels finally don't hurt anymore. I work at my computer all day and have one of those sit/stand desks. I prefer to stand because it's more comfortable on my hips, knees and the PSOAS muscle (please google that, you'll be glad you did) tends to stay extended rather than shorten from sitting, which creates other issues. However even with the comfy gel foot mat I bought my feet were hurting, ALL DAY. these shoes are amazing. If you are able to wear these to work I urge you to buy them. I wish CROCS would make a closed toe working shoe with this type of design."
Crocs,Women's Reviva Flip Flop,B07CN3BDNW,RY1YEQ7FJH5AN,"August 21, 2019",3,Comfortable but not perfect,"Wore this for 2 days on a trip where we walked about 6 miles total. Day 1 was perfect but on day 2 I noticed a faint line of blood about 2 inches long had formed on the top of each foot. The material along the inner edges had basically rubbed the skin raw. Bummer because other than that, these are very comfortable."
Crocs,Women's Reviva Flip Flop,B07CN3BDNW,R3W3HIJ5SV4KXA,"September 10, 2019",5,Perfection!,"This is my 10th or so pair of Crocs flip-flops and by far my favorite, so much so that I ordered a second pair. They're true to size. The cobblestone color is neutral but not boring. The pad of this flip flop has ridges that are soft yet massage-y. Even the little piece that goes in between the toes is comfortable. I have musculoskeletal issues that impact my lower body so if I can recommend them that's saying something."
Crocs,Women's Reviva Flip Flop,B07CN3BDNW,R2N1OBRV8HVHF8,"July 11, 2019",5,My aching bones are no more!,"Six months ago I moved into a house which is built on a slab, never expecting that within a few months my hips and knees would feel as if they were grinding, bone on bone. I was in a lot of pain. Then a friend suggested I start wearing comfy shoes around the house (I'm always barefoot here at the beach). I ordered these Crocs and within about two weeks, started feeling less pressure in my joints. They are light and super comfy, and I love the feel of the ribbing under my feet. Would definitely recommend them."
Crocs,Women's Reviva Flip Flop,B07CN3BDNW,R3HOAA1M0Z6IKE,"July 31, 2019",5,Love them! A little odd at first but got over that after a day...,"I love these. I have plantar fasciitis and these really help. I've been wearing these and another pair of Croc flip-flops once I am home from work and basically all day on the my days off- it's really helped my feet. Highly recommend. The first few times I wore these, they did tend to feel a little painful because of the bumps/pressure knobs on the shoe. But that went away after wearing them for a few hours over a few days; I think my feet were just so tight and stressed out- the bumps/pressure knobs seem to work some of that out."
Crocs,Women's Reviva Flip Flop,B07CN3BDNW,RA65NERXVD33U,"January 15, 2020",5,Walking on clouds!!,"I have several pair of Crocs and I know how comfy they are.  After the beginnings of some small issues with my feet my Dr. suggested I wear supportive shoes, even in the house and especially with hard wood floors.  I live in flip flops or go barefoot.  Supportive shoes in the house - no way!!  Bought these and they are like walking on clouds!!!!  Supportive for your entire foot.  Not just certain areas but everything from heal to toe.  Plus they look great, not like old people shoes!!  Please if you are considering buying these give them a try, they are awesome!!!"
Crocs,Women's Reviva Flip Flop,B07CN3BDNW,RBDXZK6MI7ML5,"January 15, 2020",5,Must have for sore feet!,"The best flip flop on the market. I have plantar fasciitis, a history of bunion surgery and generally overworked feet from Nursing. Croc flops are supportive with invigorating sole beds. Not irritating at all. The piece in between the toes is also very soft and easy to wear. Cobble color is the perfect neutral."
Crocs,Women's Reviva Flip Flop,B07CN3BDNW,R1B0QWALAJG2V4,"August 31, 2019",5,Perfect in every way!,"I have tried numerous flip flops/sandals to be used for everyday wear and there have been many failures.  These are the best ever!  They look better in person than in the picture and they are like walking on pillows!  No fit issues at all.  I originally thought the only drawback that might come out of it would be that the little massager things on the sole of my foot would be irritating, but they weren't.  As long as they don't change these in any way, I will recommend them to others and continue buying them!"
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Mesh Sandal Flat,B07DLK7WFQ,R2YSMLSO8NPH9G,"August 29, 2017",5,I needed footwear that I could comfortable get wet - these worked great,"I ordered these for a Women's Outdoor weekend when I realized only a few days before I left that I needed footwear that I could comfortable get wet.  Since the summer season is winding down here, I figured the local stores wouldn't have much selection and turned to amazon.  I knew I wanted something a bit sturdier then the typical neoprene water shoe but I also didn't want to spend $50+ on some of the more well known outdoor brands. After looking at a ton of products and reading way too many reviews, I decided to try the corcs mesh sandals.  I will admit, a bit of me died inside to be ordering a pair of crocs - I still picture them as being the big rubber bucket shoes.  While these still have the rubber plastic type sole that the crocs brand is known for, the rest of them are a bit more aesthetically appealing to me.  I would feel comfortable wearing these on the weekend to run errands in addition to wearing them to the beach.  I normally wear 7.5 shoes and if those don't fit, I usually have to size down, so I went with a size 7 in these and they fit perfectly. The mesh upper material is sturdy and quick drying.  I like that there are cutouts around the foot bed that allowed the water to drain in and out of the shoe more freely while actually in the water - it avoids having water still sloshing around in your shoes once you leave the water.  Another thing that attracted me to this particular shoe was that it did have the velcro closure and the ankle.  I was looking for something that I knew I could tighten down enough that they wouldn't get sucked off in the mud and silt of the lake bottom when walking the kayak or board out to deep enough water. The sole is is just the right thickness - thin enough to allow good movement and foot flexibility, but thick enough that stepping on rocks didn't hurt.  I like that there is the little rubber toe guard to help protect against rocks that may be below the water - or even just everyday obstacles.  I wore these for kayaking, stand up paddle boarding (sup), and even a hike through the woods that was just under a mile in length. I did not experience any rubbing or foot discomfort during any of the events."

Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Mesh Sandal Flat,B07DLK7WFQ,RT8G6C01GWHNP,"April 6, 2017",1,"Too big, very wide.",I'm usually a 8/8.5. I ordered the 8M and it was way to big. Very wide. Returned. I could also tell the top of the strap would rub and hurt my foot because it was so loose. I have narrow feet so might work better for those with wider feet.

Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Mesh Sandal Flat,B07DLK7WFQ,R1EWK34C6F99XP,"May 8, 2018",5,The best,"I am in LOVE. Perfect size. They are so adorable. I can wear them to the beach, in the water, to the pool.....but.....I can wear them to work in the summer with a cute black skirt. Nobody will know they are for the beach. They are so cute. And what I love about ALL my Crocs: 1. My feet don't sweat in them. 2-they don't scuff or get dirty. You literally rinse them with water. 3- they don't smell like shoes because of the material. Best shoes ever. When I wear them out I will replace with another pair. People who don't like Crocs don't understand them."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Mesh Sandal Flat,B07DLK7WFQ,R185V8C3PAFBPT,"June 10, 2017",4,Not your Typical Croc Sole,"Nice wide fit.  It is good for aerobic activity in hot weather when a sneaker would be too much.  However, it has no real arch support, and the sole is on the thinner side.  It is not the typical thick Crocs sole.  I put a pair of arch supports in these shoes, and they now work fine.  Very wide cut.  No possibility of pinched toes or blisters.  They only run in whole sizes, but if you are a half size, there is no need to order the next size up.  I am usually a size 9 1/2 in sneakers, and a size 9 fit fine."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Mesh Sandal Flat,B07DLK7WFQ,R1T8MOKKUH1QY6,"July 17, 2018",5,Fit is great and soooo comfortable !!!,"I was not sure about these shoes when I ordered them but the reviews seemed rather favorable.  I have multiple foot issues which includes hammer toe, neuropothy in both feet and legs and a very high arch which all tend to become very painful at the end of the day.  These shoes are absolutely perfect !!! They have the comfort of Crocs with a mesh top and an adjustable strap for good fit, and an arch support that takes care of the high arch issues I have.  I usually order a size  8.5 ( W US) but I ordered the size 8 in this shoe and they fit just fine.  The toe box is rather snug but I think the size 9 would have been too large.  I can highly recommend this shoe.  The only color that was available at the time I ordered was black.  But I will look for other colors and will order another pair.  I think that they are actually made for outdoor water situations but I intend to wear mine indoors.  You will not be disappointed !!"

The mesh upper and holes along the sides help foot to breath since the soles do not. Nice sturdy kick plate over toes. Very light weight. I’m ready to test them out!
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Mesh Sandal Flat,B07DLK7WFQ,R2WUXISVHTSYZQ,"May 16, 2017",5,I really like these shoes,"I really like these shoes.  However contrary to some comments, they do run small in terms of length. I would normally wear a size 8 (maybe 8.5) and the 8 was too small. The 9 worked just fine - and they are nice and wide."

These also dry quickly which is great,This is my first pair of crocs. I do crew rowing in the summer. I usually wear a 7 1/2 but went with the 7 from previous reviews and they fit perfect. These also dry quickly which is great. They don't start to smell like other water shoes I've had. These also don't have a material liner or padding on the bottom that comes out and tears like other shoes do. I've used these for about a month so far and no complaints.
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Mesh Sandal Flat,B07DLK7WFQ,R3U7FIV0PHKOA5,"September 10, 2018",2,Underwhelming and slippery.,These are rather underwhelming shoes. They were slippery on a wet boat deck and a wet dock so that made them worthless for the reason I got them. They’re also slippery in wet grass and not fast to put on. They fill with sand or rocks or gravel if you’re walking on those surfaces. I really can’t see how they’re good at anything. I’ve been wearing them around the house since they failed at all the outdoor tasks. I’m pretty disappointed I purchased them. They don’t dry very fast either. Stick with the regular crocs or Keens. These aren’t the fabulous in between you’re looking for.
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Mesh Sandal Flat,B07DLK7WFQ,RZZ2BP06EU2VY,"August 26, 2018",4,Comfortable sandal even if you have special needs,"These shoes were purchased for someone else who has had difficulty finding comfortable non-slip shoes.  The recipient had polio as a child, and this means that any shoes purchased must have a lift installed.  The recipient has purchased shoes from Crocs before, and has had good luck with them, but has recently begun complaining that the strap across the arch was causing discomfort.  Someone else recommended this style, so we ordered them.  The recipient likes the shoes, but is still getting used to them, and advises that the straps are more comfortable than some shoes ordered in the past which did not fit properly and cost a great deal more.  Previous offerings from Crocs did not have the traction insole, and that is taking some time to get used to, but overall a good shoe at a decent price."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Mesh Sandal Flat,B07DLK7WFQ,RQ0Q7FZ04OTAW,"October 15, 2018",4,Less than expected quality,"I bought these Crocs to use for water aerobics. I have neuropathy and arthritis in both feet so need something to absorb the shock of the exercises. Over all, these shoes are great for the aerobics, they have a snug fit that doesn't slip and enough cushion for the support I need. They are very comfortable. I couldn't give 5 stars because after only a month of use, the velcro does not stay secure any more. I use the shoes about 2 times a week, alternating with another type I own on the other days, so it is not from over use. If the eyelet didn't hold the strap I couldn't use them.  I don't expect velcro to work forever, but do expect more than one month."

Changed colors as well to the black and grey because I thought the light grey would show dirt and these will be getting lots of outdoor time when the weather permits. Wish they had a black with teal trim color option. My advice, size down if you are in between sizes and have slim to medium size feet."

They have straps for ankle support. The mesh top is easy on the feet, as opposed to strappy sandals which dig into my skin more than anything. And they have that Crocs' material at the bottom which makes them super comfortable. These actually feel like my feet are getting mini massages every time I wear them.  These shoes remain comfortable even if my feet are swollen. I have no complaints about them and I always get a lot of compliments when I wear them, people telling me how cute they are."

I ordered a Size 7 because that is what I wear. Perfect fit, not tight and not loose. I love the colour and they will go with the outfits that I wear to the gym. Looks nice with a pair of jeans as well and a nice top. I didn't expect them to be sooo comfy. The colours even though grey vibrant with the aqua blue. I am gonna wear them until I wear them out and then use them for the chlorinated water in the gym pool' You will be happy with your purchase. I will most likely order in other colours"

These shoes are light and comfortable in the pool. I am able to swim during deep water aerobics with these shoes on.

I ordered the size that I normally wear in original Crocs, which usually feel a bit tight. Unfortunately, that same size in the Literide swallows my feet. So, husband got the wrong sized shoe and I ordered a size down. Which worked out for the best. Wore these at Disneyland and Las Vegas for a week each and I cannot believe how much foot pain was avoided by doing so. My normal rotation is to bring 3 pairs of shoes on theme parking/heavy walking trips: a pair of Keens sandals, a new pair of Sketchers Go-Walk, and Crocs mostly for wearing inside the hotel room. Every day I'd rotate to try and keep my feet from wearing down the shoes and inevitably my feet would be killing me after a few days. Not much exaggeration - there would be an intense pain as if the whole bottom of my foot was deeply bruised and set on fire. It'd be torture to walk so I'd hobble. I wore these Literide's for the first time this year and completely bypassed footpain. I was stunned. There's more cushion than the old Croc clogs, they are much lighter, and look so much better. This is the best shoe, period. My husband surprisingly agrees - he wore them every day for about 3 weeks on various vacation and conference attending. Highly recommend using some   on the top of your foot if you're not used to going sockless. I've tried various other sticks and gels but this stuff was also wonderful and super convenient to carry with you since the packets are so small."
Crocs,Men's and Women's Literide Clog | Casual Slip on | Comfort Technology,B076JKPZGT,RKDTHR6166PLO,"March 31, 2019",4,Exellent Crocs!!!,"I've had four major lumbar surgeries and swear by Crocs.  My previous ones were both Duet Plus, but they've been discontinued.  So I searched around the Croc website and found these new LiteRide versions.  I can say, without exaggerating, that these are BETTER!  The footbed is true to their claim - squishier gel, but excellent arch support.  The outsole is the same durable and grippy stuff as always.  I love the new style of many more, smaller holes in the top surface, rather than less of the bigger holes.  And the slightly hooked heel hangs on to your foot a little better - you never have to use the strap, for any application, except maybe slogging through heavy, soft mud.  Like all Crocs, they go anywhere, wash off easily in the shower, and can be polished or sealed with Croc oil or any similar product to keep them looking great for years.  Get some - you will not be dissappointed. Additional note - a few reviewers say these are narrower.  This is true, but unless you have very side feet, this isn't an issue.  I wear shoes that are typically one width wider, and my Duets were a big floppy on my feet.  When I'd walk in water or in the rain on uneven surfaces, they'd move around a bit.  I never got blisters, but I would have rather had less play in roominess.  With these new LiteRides, in my opinion, the width is perfect - just the right amount of touch front to back, side to side, top to bottom. And the Amazon price was less than the Croc website, and that's without the Prime no cost shipping!"

I bought the first pair during a stop over in Puerto Rico while on a cruise 2 months ago. Liked them so much that I bought another pair to use as my home slippers. This style of Croc seems to have more cushion than the classic style and they are very comfortable as a result.  They are also great to wear by the pool, etc. and because of all the vent holes my feet do not sweat like they do with some other styles that I own.  Highly recommended Croc’s!"

While I like the more streamlined look and the foot bed is definitely soft and comfortable, It was nort as comfy or supportive as the old duet sport model that I'm still wearing to death now. As a matter fact there was less arch support  and for some odd reason my feet felt less stable in them rather than equally or more, which was a real disappointment. I wish they would just bring back the duet sport  and be done with it. It's the only model I've found to be comfortable while still being supportive and stable. I guess I'm just gonna stop buying crocs with the hope thatthat they will once again produce something like they used to."
Crocs,Men's and Women's Literide Clog | Casual Slip on | Comfort Technology,B076JKPZGT,R2SK3T721NM0J1,"September 26, 2019",1,Not as comfortable as everyone else claims. Chinese knock offs. Not original Vietnam crocs.,They Are decent but not as good as everybody else is raving about. They seem to fit in their narrower  then normal crocs do. What I love about crocs is the wide width for my fat feet. These seem to fit tighter around the instep and toebox. My little toe touches the edge of the croc and therefore I have to periodically readjust my foot so my foot fits better inside the croc.  They are comfortable as far as the foot bed goes however the fit leaves a little to be desired in this they only deserve three stars versus five stars if they fit perfectly. Update: After doing some research I found out that these pair of crocs that I purchased are in fact made in China and not the originals made in Vietnam. I have two different pair of crocs made in Vietnam and they are great fit. I’ve reduced my rating from three stars down to one star and I have requested a refund from Amazon. I sure wish they carried better quality made Vietnam ones and it’s a crapshoot as to what they’ll send you.

I measured my bare feet heel to toe and it was 11”. I ended up buying a size 11 Mens in this and it fit the length of my foot perfectly, not too much extra space. For reference, I wear 11.5 in Nike, Adidas, and Vans. If your measurements are like mine get a size 11 for sure. I took a pic of the size 11 next to my classic clogs size 10. Now onto the clogs. These are narrower than the traditional clogs. This is like the slim fit version of its cousin. The toe box is narrower and just the general profile is narrower so this is a heads up for people with wide feet. You might wanna size up for wide feet but the length will probably be too long. The clogs are very comfortable if you have heel pain and already as comfortable as my very worn in classic clogs. They also look more aesthetically pleasing."

We have been buying crocs for years because they wear great, are so comfortable and we love the designs...in this case the sparkles! These are not super wide which works well for us. They can be worn in the rain without damaging the shoe, are very bendy (great for very active kids) and they always look great! They are soft and pliable...so no breaking in!"

As Per the crocs.com website, I was advised to order a size 12. - That advise is WRONG! - A size 12 was way too large. I reordered a size 11 and they fit ok...somewhat too large. - My toes have approximately 1/2 inch or a little more extra room / space from touching the top. - As I walk...it's almost like wearing flip-flops. I ordered a size 10 and they are too small...no long enough at the top for my toes. - At 10 1/2 inches in size, it would have been a perfect fit with just an extra 1/4 inches space. If crocs made half (1/2) inch sizes; 10 1/2 inches...IT WOULD BE A PERFECT FIT...as these crocs run on the somewhat large side! Great Product! Nicely Constructed!"

I measured my feet even and compared to the chart to make sure it would be the correct size.  Item arrived and was way too small not only length but width.  Ordered a size 12 but they are so skinny that I cant wear them for any period of time (more than 10-15min).  I normally am able to grab a pair of shoes size 11 off the shelf with no problem.  These shoes are not standard size.  Sending both of them back for a refund.

If you plan wear socks, may put pressure around the toes area, so you may have to wiggle around your toes till it feels comfortable in order to get the ideal walking experience Not slip on shoes as some adjustments are need on the back end. Feels a bit odd while putting them on barefoot as it feels like you're putting on a wet suit for your feet. Very snug fit once you have everything setup These are great for casual strolls on the beach, around the neighborhood, pool,lake or at home. Beach setting is ideal as you get secure fit like wearing shoes, but water is able drain out of the holes On the flip side, do not wear on dirt trails as small rocks may enter the small holes on the side. Seeing there are holes covering the shoes; careful where you walk as you don't want anything to snag on it Very comfortable like other Croc shoes as long as you're walking on a flat or sandy surface. Not meant for sports or physical activity that doesn't involve walking as if you pivot your feet a lot like when swing a bat, positioning yourself while rock climbing, or doing a strong left hook while punching it's very uncomfortable as the bend the in plastic to your skin/socks has a off feeling to it Super breathable with nice airflow especially when barefoot. After a while you won't notice you have them on. Fashion varies by person, but i think it looks okay. Has a more slick design than traditional crocs Overall, very situational pair of shoes. In the right environments it can be very comfortable to wear"

This summer was so wet and rainy, that the fields where the concerts are held were constantly muddy.  These shoes were perfect for wearing in the mud.  They fit well and were comfortable.  The best part was, we could simply hose them off when we got home, and they were good as new.  And, they look more like tennis shoes than typical Crocs!"

After 4 months of use, I can say that these fit the bill. No blisters on my feet either. Sure, there's a group of fashionistas that make fun of me for wearing Croc's during a workout, but (1) if they're focusing on what's on my feet instead of lifting weights, they don't belong there anyway, and (2) Deadpool wears these too...and he's a badass.

Light weight, comfortable with expected crocs styling. The negative, and why I gave only 3 stars... the upper part gets really HOT!!! Maybe I should have picked a different color?

I was looking for ones that didn't look like normal crocs but were still Crocs if that makes sense. Comfort wise, they seem okay. I haven't used them yet for any long distance walking or anything but a quick trip to the store or casual walk, they seem to be pretty comfortable. These will also work great for my upcoming beach trip too. I normally wear a size 12 and got the size 11 shoes. Kind of wished they had an 11 1/2 as that would've been perfect. The 11 seems a bit snug to get on but fit very well otherwise."

We love croc shoes- their slip-ons out of cloth/leather are amazingly comfortable and always a nice fit.  These particular shoes seem to be mis-molded.  The insert hole for your foot forces your foot to be way back and your heel overhangs- we tried two sizes to no avail.  Your heel hangs off the back edge of the shoe and your toes never reach anywhere near the font of the shoe.  Love crocs, but we could not make these work."

They fit great, they have good soles and, so far, they have held up fine.  They interface well with the surface of my paddle board.  Some support is provided even with a relatively low sole.  They actually provide better grip on my paddle board than my bare feet. Oh and they look better than most watersheds."

Wears them everyday like he owns no other shoes or something. Always talking bout how breezy his toes are. I can't even with him!!! I am not a fan of the look of croacs myself but these actually look more stylish than the rest of their products, has a sporty running shoe lookalike when he puts them on. Oh, don't let me forget, he goes nuts about the fact that they have a strap on the back or whatever because they never come off when he's on the bike. 10 out of 10 but there are only 5 stars"
Crocs,Men's Swiftwater Wave Sandal Flat,B07L95JZ5X,R1L5W75QO9JW94,"April 24, 2018",4,Too small.,My husband wears a size 9.5 so I ordered the 9 going off a lot of reviews that said they ran large.  They were way too small.  He couldn't get his foot into them.  If you have a narrow foot or a low instep they would probably work.  I'm giving them 4 stars because they are nice looking shoes for what they are and the sizing problem is really just an issue with width/instep.  I believe the length would have been fine.  Easy return w/Amazon.
Crocs,Men's Swiftwater Wave Sandal Flat,B07L95JZ5X,R2D0HM4D1O58U5,"July 18, 2017",3,Not as comfy as they should be,"Returning these. The Croslite footbed material on these shoes does not extend to the outer edges of the soles of my feet; the harder material that the upper part of the shoe is made of is connected to the footbed at its outer edge, and I find it uncomfortable where my arch rests against this harder material. For me, Crocs are all about the comfy Croslite memory material forming to my foot; this harder, wear-resistant material that Crocs has been using in some of their shoes significantly decreases the comfort factor in my opinion. This is the second pair of Crocs that incorporate this harder wear-resistant material that I am returning: the other pair I'm returning is the Duet Max Clog, which uses the harder material for the entire sole of the shoe, but does have a layer of softer Croslite material for the footbed. The hard sole does not have the give of the full Croslite sole, which is the whole point of Crocs in the first place."

I took them to the north shore in Oahu and almost got murdered by the waves because these shoes drag you down, collect sand, collect rocks and keep your feet from moving. Get these if you want a good croc for mowing the lawn. If you need something for the beach then get a boot/sock shoe."

I own these shoes alread and love them so mush, I’m afraid that Croc will stop producing the and wanted replacements. I will say this, I did notice that the sole is a little thin at the ball of your foot and was wearing quickly. I cut a piece of Gorilla Tape and put in this location and it stopped the wear. When the tape wears through, I’ll replace the tape. I even did this for the new pairs in storage."

They won't be confused for the original clown-shoe Crocs. I wear a 9.5 but chose the size 9 over size 10 to ensure a snug fit. The fit is perfect for a water shoe and I have no concerns about them slipping off under any condition. Hope they last a long time.

No big deal for the amount of time that I'll be wearing at the beach. But needs to be mentioned. We'll see how they stand up to the hot sand.

This particular set though fits slightly differently  than others, and in my case, makes this croc fit not as well as all others--it is too small: I now figured it out: the white trim/banding around the shoe makes it better for walking in sloshy or wet areas, but it has no perforated holes as the regular crocs have in that area... in my case, it constrains some of my toes more than the regular crocs and so makes it too small to fit with the heel sling in place...so i have to use this pair strictly as clogs without the heel band. I still like wearing them though. Better buy one half size larger if you can..."

I could have maybe lived without using the heel strap if the color was good, or lived with the color if the shoes fit."
Crocs,Crocband Clog | Comfortable Slip on Casual Water Shoe,B01HQAM2GG,R2H771DR2NIL1P,"December 11, 2018",5,Crocs are good for your feet!,Bought my first pair on a lark because they were on sale.  This purchase makes my 5th pair.  I have had several surgeries on my feet and right ankle so Crocs have made the perfect shoe because the toe box is very wide (to accommodate swollen feet) and the shoe bed provide arch support and an inch of solid cushioning.  That cushioning helps people with arthritic knees or bad backs in a way that no house shoe will ever do. *Do not leave your Crocs out in the direct sun or out in freezing temperatures because they will shrink or otherwise deteriorate since they are a rubber-like material.
Crocs,Crocband Clog | Comfortable Slip on Casual Water Shoe,B01HQAM2GG,R3N5TTST8XH1EV,"May 3, 2018",4,IMHO (with note about sizing...),"This was my first purchase of a Crocs product, so I didn't know what to expect. I read many reviews to understand why they are so popular, and figured that I would give them a try. One of the reviews that I read indicated that they run small so order one size up--I wear a men's size 11 so I ordered a size 12. The Crocs arrived and were TOO LARGE by approximately one size--I returned them for a men's 11 and the fit is perfect so they run true to size, in my case at least. Otherwise, they are a different fit from your usual shoe and require some getting used to. I am a medium width and they are wide through the ball and toe areas on me, but oddly they are not too loose on me--maybe attributable to my high arch. They do not cause any pressure points for me although, initially, I was concerned that they may be uncomfortable where my toes contacted the tips while walking (they do not contact while standing on level ground), however wearing them for several hours while gardening presented no issues at all. Without the strap flipped to the back I have to either grip with my toes or kinda shuffle when I walk otherwise they kind of shift around on my feet, but I adjusted quickly and didn't find this to be and issue either...they're not track cleats after all. They cushion the soles pretty well, although a good pair of flip-flops provide equal comfort. Overall I'm satisfied with them...but not over the moon."

Such a cute, sporty look. I usually wear an 8.5 shoe, so some styles of crocs fit me best in 8, I got these in size 9 and I’m very happy with them. I have pretty wide feet and these are super comfy.  I’ve read some other reviews where people say that the back strap is too short, on the contrary I actually think that the strap is better shorter, as I have Baya clogs that have a longer strap and they’re always sliding down my heel and need to be adjusted all the time. These actually stay put and keep my foot from sliding around. I love these and plan to order more colors, you can’t beat amazons prices, I got the black and white pair for $19 and they’re $39.99 on the crocs website."

People will make fun of you, but screw them. Show that you have enough confidence in yourself to wear Crocks out. It builds character, and chicks love a man that exudes confidence.  I wear a size 9 all day long and have for years. However I had to get the size 8, so here's what you do. Order your normal size, and then order a size smaller than usual at the same time with the intention of sending one back. That's what I did, and you'll thank me later. The way they are built, one size smaller might work better for you. If I wouldn't of order a size smaller at the same time I wouldn't have know how well they can fit. The size you don't want is totally easy to return at any UPS store. ProTip. Crocs with Socks is the only way to go. So soft and comfy, like walking on baby butts."

For the first week they fit perfectly. They were comfortable and had just enough room to slip on easily without being sloppy. Fast forward a few weeks and they have literally shrunk three sizes to the point where I can't wear them. The width has contracted so much that they won't fit my feet and sit askew when I pry my foot into them. It's the oddest thing, one week they fit and the next they have shrunk so much they're almost small enough to hang from my rear view mirror. There must be something in the rubber compound that is not right as I have a hard to believing this is normal. Anyhow, if you take a chance on this particular style of Croc I would suggest oversizing at least two sizes if this typical."

They are fine without the heel strap but a tiny bit short with the strap. The footbed shape also doesn't quite work for my foot; the arch seems to be in the wrong place, which makes for a sort of awkward fit. Fine for gardening and garage work (although it's kind of annoying when dirt gets in through the holes), but I would not walk around in these. My husband loves his, so it really just depends on your fit."

I have a fuzzy navy pair, a camo pair, a royal blue pair, and a green pair.  They are so versatile and comfy!  I hadn't had a pair in this style before so I thought I'd give it a shot.  For some reason, this style fits a whole size smaller than usual.  I usually wear an 11, so I ordered an 11 and it was an entire shoe size too small.  I returned them for a 12, and then they fit like my original 11's did.  Compared to my camo and green pairs, these are less squishy, but I expect them to soften up after some wear."

I ordered two pairs of each in the same size 9 and these were a lot smaller. Had to do a refund and waiting on the next size up to see how they fit. Will update when they come in. * Update* The size 10 only fits right if I don't use the band for the back. If I put it in the back of my ankle, since the band is shorter than the back edge of the Crocs, it pushes my foot forward and squishes my toes against the front. I'm keeping them to wear without the band, otherwise, you'd have to go up yet another size and then they'd be huge. Very strange but they are very comfortable and much better than the originals. Wish they would make the band a little longer."

The reason I bought these is that they are definitely cooler to wear in the summer, they slip on and off so easily, and I can wear them for short periods of time without my arches aching.  Because of this, I didn't feel I should rate ""for how long can you wear them comfortably"" and ""do these shoes provide good arch support"".  The first time I tried them on (after receiving them) they felt very comfortable!... I have tried on imitation crocs in several stores and they have never felt comfortable enough for me to buy them.

If they had half sizes, they would be a perfect fit. I think the next size up will be a bit big but since they are just house shoes, it's okay. Very comfortable. Overall, I really like these!"

Crocs,Men's and Women's Baya Clog |Comfortable Slip on Casual Water Shoe,B00HWSV2YG,R2K374V5WZ9RFL,"November 5, 2016",1,BEWARE!!,"This version of the clog - the 'GRAPHITE/GRAPHITE' is EXACTLY the same as the 'Graphite' one. But this one is about $10 more expensive for NO apparent reason, other than you're paying $10 more for the extra 'GRAPHITE' in its name. I had purchased these and the SINGLE Graphite version. But when I couldn't tell the difference between the 2 clogs, I sent these back for a refund.  I had left another review like this. But the seller never bothered to contact me. OH - these did come in a semi-beaten box held together with tape. The other EXACT pair, came in a plastic bag. So, I guess, the extra $10 was for the box"

They are comfortable and fit as expected. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. I just have to keep them away from my dogs. They already ate my husband's pair! (If it helps anyone, I would like to add that my husband wears his Crocs around the house because he has plantar fasciitis and his doctor recommended that he do so. He said it's been helping him with the pain a lot.) They also make great shower shoes when you're camping!"
Crocs,Men's and Women's Baya Clog |Comfortable Slip on Casual Water Shoe,B00HWSV2YG,R5F8CJMGJEIOY,"January 5, 2020",5,Love these!,"I ordered these when they were on sale for Black Friday or Cyber Monday, I can't remember.  The size in the color I really wanted was sold out so I ended up ordering the Cerulean Blue.  They are a fabulous color!  I'm super happy with my second color choice.  My normal shoe size is a 7-7 1/2.  I remembered that Crocs are supposed to fit, according to the employees in my local store, ""like they're fall off but not"".  I decided not to order the larger size and went with a Women's 7.  They are perfect.  Not small and not that falling off that I don't like.  Comfy, easy to slip on and off, and great color.  I've even worn them out in public, lol.  I wish I had ordered more."
Crocs,Men's and Women's Baya Clog |Comfortable Slip on Casual Water Shoe,B00HWSV2YG,RG1DQXKP9N76C,"January 27, 2020",4,"Seems good, but slightly smaller than previous pairs.","This looks and feels like quality material.  But even though I ordered this exact size twice before, this third pair is smaller than both previous pairs.  It's a little tighter width, and not as long.  They fit, but are snug, unlike the previous pairs.  Must have been made in a different location. I haven't worn them very much since we're having cold and snow, but did wear them on a warm day, and around the house, and they feel good.  We'll have to see how they hold up once the warm weather gets here."
Crocs,Men's and Women's Baya Clog |Comfortable Slip on Casual Water Shoe,B00HWSV2YG,R1ENFZ5OS6E3MV,"July 7, 2011",5,Comfy but not a best fit,"Bought my first pair of Crocs recently, after thinking about buying a pair for years and years.  They certainly are comfortable, although I find without socks my feet get a little um, moist, inside the Croc, and I tend to slide around inside the shoe bed. The sizing was a bit of an issue; I didn't heed the advice to try them on in a store first, and just purchased a pair online.  I'm a solid ten, but since many reviews mentioned buying a smaller size, and Crocs sadly don't come in half sizes, I went for the ten.  They are decidedly large, although wearable, but I have tripped a few times, and I find the wider toe has the potential to trip me up as well.  I have  some ambulatory issues to boot, no pun intended, so I really have to watch my step when wearing the Crocs outdoors.  I have taken to just wearing the Crocs around the house, but that's fine.  In the end, I also recommend trying a pair on for proper sizing first, before buying online. Best part, totally washable in the sink or shower, and air drys in minutes.  Aside from the fit, I'm giving these shoes the total big five stars, for general all around comfort, maintenance, longevity (yes, although I haven't had them very long, I bet I'll still be wearing them in 5 years) and low price. EDIT:  Now that chillier weather has set in, I'm wearing socks with my Crocs, and find the fit is better, of course, and less sliding around.  I still like them, and will get another pair, in five years or so, when these wear out."

Crocs,Women's Busy Day Stretch Asymmetrical Wedge,B010WF2BGI,R3SPDW7FYFZDPJ,"March 12, 2018",4,My perfect work shoe.,"I love these shoes. With my job I never know what kind of day I'm going to have whether it be behind a desk all day, working in labs, searching for inventory, etc. Some days I may only walk 1000 steps during the day to upwards of 15,000. These are my favorite work shoes. They are closed toed and professional in appearance. The comfort cannot be beat. The rubber sole offers support while forming to your foot.  This is my second pair. After wearing the first pair almost daily a hole appeared in toe area where my big toe rubbed through the fabric. The only reason I do not give these 5 stars is I actually have to cut these to make them fit ideally. I have a high arch in my foot so support band across the top of the foot is a little too tight for me and the heel rubs the back part of my foot causing a blister. I make three cuts with an exacto-o-blade to offset these problems and then the shoes becomes a dream. I was worried that cutting the structure would cause fraying but these shoes are well made that no one ever noticed my modifications. My only other advice is to make sure you wear socks or clean out the rubber sole with a disinfectant wipe in you're wearing barefoot. This will help keeps the soles clean and odor free."
Crocs,Women's Busy Day Stretch Asymmetrical Wedge,B010WF2BGI,R7JH49ZAQWFVN,"April 5, 2017",5,Best shoes for waitresses and nurses!,"I would give these shoes 6 stars if I could. I am a waitress and am on my feet 7 hours straight each shift so having good shoes is not only important for comfort but crucial for physical health. As with any athletic shoe or shoe you will be walking or running in, you always want to go a half size to a full size up than what youre used to wearing in flats or casual shoes. I am usually a size 6.5 and i got a size 7 and they are perfect. If you are gonna be on your feet all day these are your shoes! Oh and theyre vegan..thats a plus!"

Crocs,Women's Busy Day Stretch Asymmetrical Wedge,B010WF2BGI,R2DOLGL2666S8B,"October 10, 2017",4,Light and comfortable for casual wear,Light weight and a nice change from tennis shoes with casual pants/leggings. Four stars instead of five because they run about 1/4 size small. I wear 8.5 to 9. I get 9's for shoes I want to wear/walk in all day. The design of the shoe moves my foot forward slightly and my toe is at the end. It doesn't hurt but I feel it. They are snug but that's also in the design of the flexible fabric on the top. I like that feature but feet that are wide or high arches may feel too snug.
Crocs,Women's Busy Day Stretch Asymmetrical Wedge,B010WF2BGI,R1J490GI6BDFQT,"August 2, 2017",4,Crocs have come a long way...,"As much as I'd like to, I have never given up leather shoes completely because I worked long, long, REALLY long shifts on my feet and APMA (American Podiatric Medical Association) approved Danish clogs were the only thing that saw me through those shifts. If you are not already aware, the few vegan APMA approved clogs available are typically either fabric (which will NOT work for most people employed in the service industry or medical field) or of such poor quality that they crack or even crumble in very short order. I don't understand why vegan clogs from the same companies that make extremely durable non-vegan clogs could have bases of such inferior quality, but there it is. Well, I no longer work in a field which requires that I wear shoes that are waterproof or water resistant, but I am still on my feet 12-14 hours a day and still searching for non-leather shoes that won't leave me in agony after so many hours. I was surprised to see that Crocs seems to be trying to step into that niche and they have some pretty good contenders. The Busy Day Wedge is one of them. After reading the reviews, I ordered a half size up. When I received the shoes I tried them on several times and went back and forth trying to determine the likelihood that they would eventually form to my foot. In the end I decided that my outer toes were a little too numb to keep them, but I don't doubt that they work for many people. I happen to need a roomier toe box, but will continue to keep an eye on Crocs' future offerings."
Crocs,Women's Busy Day Stretch Asymmetrical Wedge,B010WF2BGI,R2CPALC3KK1FC4,"July 15, 2016",2,Pretty snug fit,"These shoes were quite snug across the top of the foot.  It didn't take long to realize that they just weren't going to work.  The style is plain, simple and functional and would have been comfortable if they weren't so snug.  I ordered a size larger than normal in hopes of gaining the extra room.  My foot is wide across the ball of my foot, but narrow across the top of the foot and heel.  I thought maybe the stretchy fabric would work.  No luck."

I normally wear around anywhere between a 10 and 11. I usually wear an 11 in Crocs. I would not have gotten a size smaller. They do fit a little snug around the toe box and I am a little wide in that part of my foot. I walk very fast and stand a lot while teaching. I notice that the sole tapers a little smaller in the middle and I kind of ""fall off"" my shoes. While standing, if I shift my weight to one side, my shoe will turn. It's a good thing I have very flexible ankles. They are very comfy and are now my new ""teacher shoes""."

I am on my feet a lot so having comfy shoes that I can wear to work was really important.  I am a size 6.5, and a 7 fit just fine with a pair of no show socks. The shoes have a nice supportive insole and fabric is stretchy over the toebox. The platform heel aint bad for the height boost either! Overall, really happy with this purchase."

I have an insane amount of crocs (even the winter boots) . All the closed toes are size 10 and they are a little too big, this pair fits perfect. So happy to have a normal looking pair of closed toed shoes for cold weather. These look nice, dressy enough to wear for casual, formal. I have only worn them around the house for 1/2 a day, they seem wonderful. Need to try them with socks. Got them on sale here, that was really a nice break"
Crocs,Women's Busy Day Stretch Asymmetrical Wedge,B010WF2BGI,R3TA6TFSJKYFWD,"November 20, 2019",5,VERY CUTE & COMFY!!!,For starters....I have a lot of foot/ankle problems.  I have plantar fasciitis and have ankle weakness mostly on my left foot....due to arch problem.  I have to say these shoes were a nice experience on my feet :)  (Happy feet) :)  They are very cushy on the sole...and foot maintained stability during my very long commute to work.  Overall I have to say if you have any foot issues or you're on your feet all day for whatever reason....these are your shoes!!!!! On another note.....they are snuggly and run a bit small.  For example....im somewhere between a 6-6.5 in shoe size depending on style of the shoe.....I bought a size 6.  I was able to get my foot in with a thin pair of stocking but was a bit snuggly to get in....but once in I was good to walk in with no issues....no blisters....nothing.  IF you plan to wear socks with these.....then go a size up or at least 1/2 size up.  I was fine with thin stocking but if you don't like snuggly shoes or like thick socks.....go up in size.  Overall.....Im glad I got them and my feet are happy too! LOL

These really surprised me.  They are very easy to walk in, the soles do offer some support and they are soft and snug enough  where they don't slip around.  They do run a bit small.  I'm normally a 10.5 so I ordered an 11 and they fit perfect.  I don't have wide feet but it seems like the top would be stretchy enough to accommodate a wider foot.  Good deal, I will definitely be looking into buying more Crocs in different styles."

I've been wearing Danskos for 15 years working 8-10 hour days in a hospital and I love them, but they're so heavy, not to mention expensive.

DON'T FALL THIS TRAP!!!,"When I ordered these,  the choices were listed as 11 and 11w. I very excitedly ordered 11w. Crocs does make wide width shoes,  I own some. They are my favourite dress shoes. But,  after 7 years, it's time to replace them. When I received them,  I saw that 11w was just 11 women's.  It was NOT wide width.  Even though these shoes are a little stretchy,  they pressed my skin and caused uncomfortable wrinkles which made them unwearable.  I am so sad I had to return them.  It's time Someone started carrying wide width dress shoes from Crocs. They are amazing. But this was not it.  Don't fall for the 11w next to 11, it's a trap."

These shoes are true to fit with my usual size and it also has stretchy uppers which feels like your foot is secure within the shoes. They are a nice basic shoe with a wedge heel and has good support and comfortable cushy insole.  They are perfect for an office setting and perfect for lots of walking.

I don't have especially wide feet and the width is perfect and the toe box roomy. no pressure on the top part as some have mentioned I also have high arches and these feel good just walking around the house. I really like the look of these and out the box they're super comfortable. the wedge isn't too high. I am a hairdresser where I have long shifts standing so I will certainly be updating this review :)

Crocs,Women's Busy Day Stretch Asymmetrical Wedge,B010WF2BGI,RAA6ANVPX0731,"October 18, 2019",5,Very comfy for prone-to-ache feet,"I have had foot pain in my arches for over a decade. I have been squeaking around in sneakers with I’ll-fitting orthotics. I needed to take the chance of pain and get shoes that would be more fitting for an interview and got these. My orthotics didn’t fit so I decided to just get through a day wearing them. I was SHOCKED at how much my feet DIDN’T ache by the end of the day! They aches even LESS than they normally do, possibly because they have a slight heel. I love them."
Crocs,Women's Unisex Bistro Work Clog,B07CN8YKHX,R33J9TL7GP97Q6,"June 2, 2019",4,"Nice work shoe, but needs modification","After browsing nonslip work shoe articles and the selections suggested, I stopped on these for the high ratings-to-affordable price ratio in order to replace my previous Reboks which were wrecking my feet and ankles. I work as a prep cook, standing and walking for 6 to 12 hrs per day, and i dont make a lot, so these seemed good all around, with the waterproof/easy clean option being a huge plus. They fit nicely, roomy for my wider foot, and I don't experience any pain. I've been getting compliments  for weeks now from both front and back of house, all ages and genders; people love the koi as much as I do. The drawbacks to these shoes are that they're not THE most slip resistant shoes out there, so if you're around a lot of oil or especially slick metal that gets wet, beware. Also, they're not as squishy as I expected them to be, but that's just my personal expectation. Now, though they are waterproof, the fact that they're made of rubber/foam becomes a problem, as there is no airflow to the feet whatsoever. If you were hoping for dry feet by the end of a shift, you won't find that due to anatomical reasons. Because i dont really tread in deep waters, my solution was this: I took a pair of pointy manicure scissors, and cut out some of the intentions on the sides (the ones that would be holes on regular crocs). As a result, my piggies are no longer suffocating and sweating, I'm not hot, and I'm still guarded against wet ground and splashes. Overall, I'm pretty happy withthese."

Crocs,Women's Unisex Bistro Work Clog,B07CN8YKHX,RN1YB58OEWTI4,"February 15, 2020",5,Great shoe for line cook,"Im a cook and have worn this shoe past 8+ years. They hold up, first pair lasted i think six years. Eventualy the nonslip soles came loose but i was regularly cleaning behind leaking fryers and standing in fry oil and degreasers/floor cleaner. Very comfortable to wear on the line, i wouldn't recommend it to servers or anyone that has to walk alot, i mostly just have to move from station to station. Walking alot in these would be hard on the legs. The nonslip soles work well, dont have to worry about slipping as much and can move faster on slippery floors. I’ve seen alot of people wipe out wearing reg soled shoes. That being said the regular crocs you find at the store probably don't have this and you will slip. Not having the holes/ air vents protects the feet from spills. These are crocs made for kitchen work. I just wear these for work and i expect them to last a long time.   The fit is roomy, i wear a 9 1/2 but 9 fits well for me with these. I think they recommend if your a half size over to go with the smaller size. The heal and with the heal strap allows for the extra space."

Thanks,"I needed these to work in a professional kitchen and they work marvelously. Not only do they work but they are a real looker! Even the most skeptical prior to buying them showed a change a quick change of heart once they saw them for what they really were. I have worn Crocs that were my US size before so I knew what to expect in terms of foot room, there's a lot of it. They do not fit tight around my foot (10 men) but they do not also give a loose feeling. Wearing the strap behind your heel solidifies any worries that it might suddenly slip right off your foot. The lil extra space that's left inside the shoe will keep your foot nice and dry for hours. I've already dropped a heavy metal basement door on them accidentally and didn't even realize it. The non slip feature is also excellent. I only wish it had come with a little comb or something to help get the muck out from between the spaces on the bottom sole. Great product."

They are especially comfortable, pretty much the most comfortable flip flop I have ever owned. I do not like the color, but they were cheap, like $13, so I bought them anyway. However, the color is true to the phot, so if this is color is what you're looking for you will be pleased.  I just wanted an extra pair to wear to the beach and these fit the bill. I prefer my black ones to wear in public. I wear those all the time, and can walk miles in them without any discomfort to my feet. I especially like that they don't look so much like what most people expect a croc to look like. I hope they continue to make these comfortable flip flops. I am very serious about ordering up. These are a full two sizes larger than what I typically wear in crocs. I bought my first pair from crocs, and most of the reviews said this and I doubted they would be that much smaller, they were and I had to return them. As long as you order up, I think you will be happy with your purchase. Please check ""Yes"" if you have found this review helpful.

No matter how I try to reason with him, he will not wear closed-toe shoes to work in, only flip flops. He works hard, and every flip flop before these has busted or become worn out totally within a few weeks of him wearing them because, well, flip flops were not made to work in like that....... However! I came across these croc flip flops in a store a while back and bought them for him since they looked tough and durable. He loves how cushiony and comfortable they are, and his first pair lasted him a year and a half before finally he wore a small hole in the sole on one of the flops. I just bought him these sandals again as his primary work shoes, and he is ecstatic to have them! If you need some sandals that are super comfortable, and HIGHLY durable, look no further. I have to say the price was great too!"

They have been the perfect flip flops and I was excited to buy another pair. However, after wearing these new ones only a couple days the foot bed developed painful ""bumps"", glue starting seeping out of seams that shouldn't have been glued, and the top band shrank. I don't know if the pair I received was defective or if these were counterfeit...this is NOT the quality I expected from a pair of Crocs.  I really hope this is not the direction Crocs are going for quality."
Crocs,Unisex Modi Sport Flip Flop,B010WFLXD0,R2UCOPYWDCYVQS,"August 16, 2018",3,Cute and comfy but very very slippery when wet.,"So, first of all, cute style and really comfy. I have moderate bunions and some basic 50 year old foot pain. Nice cushy foot base. I frequently go barefoot, so my feet aren't super sensitive on the bottoms so I wasn't bothered by the little nubs on the foot bed. I was disappointed by the fact that when they get wet, they are incredibly slippery. Not so much on the bottoms, the traction seems ok, but really slippery on the foot bed area. When wet, my feet are slipping all around. Not at all what I was hoping for. I will probably keep them, but just try to use them for situations when I am not going to have wet feet. Definitely not for the lake or the beach."

They were a comfortable, durable, heavy solid material, they made no noise when walking and did not cause my feet to sweat. This new version is everything those were NOT, with the one exception: they are still comfortable. The new build material is the cos-light and the previous ones were not. My feet sweat in these, they did not with the previous material. It could be in 100 degree weather all day and nothing. These if I'm just wearing them around the house, my feet sweat and slip. They do offer support which is much needed with flat feet in a flip flop. Wish I could get another pair of the old version, the toe strap on the old ones broke after several years"

I have had problems with plantar fasciitis in the past and must be extra careful about the shoes I wear. Although these are comfortable enough that I'd be tempted to wear them for long walks I'll force myself to don those hot, clunky walking shoes (aka cross-trainers) with orthotics inside.

They retain the primary benefit/feature of traditional crocs in that they are made of a unique rubber/plastic/polymer type material. This makes them extremely comfortable and soft, but they are also easily washable and can be easily disinfected and even autoclaved. I wear flip flops in the summer, and some of my other memory foam/standard cushioning flip flops get a bit stinky. The secondary benefit is that these don't look as unstylish and awful as traditional corcs. I'm sold."
Crocs,Unisex Modi Sport Flip Flop,B010WFLXD0,R1YH5RHGC0MMAD,"October 5, 2019",5,Extremely comfortable for fussy feet,"I was a late-to-the-sandals party guy, having been exclusively tennis shoes for most of my life. About 10 years ago I moved to a warmer climate, so sandals became a more practical footwear choice. I have tried a variety of different styles since then, and found most uncomfortable. I couldn't tolerate straps between the toes, and I found the kind that had no straps to be too insecure. In short, I discovered I am a fussy footwear fellow. Well a few years back I discovered the crocs sandals. And while I will continue to mock anyone who would wear the regular croc monstrosities (a real indicator one has given up on life) their sandals are extremely comfortable, and thankfully look nothing like the classic crocs seen styled by geriatrics and toddlers. I buy a new pair of these every other year; the build is solid and lasts that long with frequent use. They take a day or two to wear in, so I have found it is best to only wear them a few hours in the first few days. After that, they are the most sublimely comfortable sandal experience I have ever worn."

They fit good but the shock absorption is next to nothing and I had a small piece of wood stick into the bottom and punch straight through and poke my foot. Luckily I felt it and stopped walking otherwise it might have broken the skin. So I looked for a  pair of flip-flop sandals with a quality foot bed and found the Croc Sandals. Even though they almost cost twice as much, they fit good and have a very nice solid foot bed that offers great shock absorption and keeps small debris from jabbing or poking you underneath. The foot bed is great and the overall build quality is great. Plenty of colors to choose from which is a nice bonus. The price is a little steep but it is worth it overall."

Crocs,Unisex Modi Sport Flip Flop,B010WFLXD0,R1FRXJLRVHJZ1U,"September 11, 2017",5,Great fit and very comfortable,these are by far my favorite flip-flops; they conform well to your feet and curve up in the front so that the toe does not catch against any kind of deviations in the pavement. They have plenty of cushion so that you could literally run in these if you need to but also are nice and comfortable for all day wear or just lounging around (They were comfortable even after an entire day walking around a hot amusement park). The last thing that these excel at is they seem to take on minimal foot odor so whatever compound they use is pretty effective.

I've been wearing these for years, probably have about a dozen pair or more. I have every color just for summer and beach wear. I wear them 100% of the time at home. Crocs doesn't make them anymore, so I'm stocking up whenever I find them on sale on other sites. At least I'll have enough to see me through the next few years."

They are always lightweight.  They never smell.  These are the most sporty version of Crocs yet.  They really hold on to your feet, but not uncomfortably.  You can go for a long walk or a hike in these no problem.  I don't really have any complaints, though it took me a short while to get used to the mix of soft and hard padding and the slightly chunkier heel.  Now they feel completely natural.

I've worn Crocs flip flops for years now and it seems every time I try a new pair lately it is hit or miss. The footbed seems too close to the thong part of the flip flop, making it an uncomfortable fit. I feel like my foot is suffocating. I hope that I can wear these around the house (as I wore them outside once and don't think I can return them) to try and stretch them, but I'm not confident. Crocs needs to get its act together."
Crocs,11033 Flip Flop,B07CN4H1ZW,R16BUEVG77KZWL,"March 10, 2016",5,My all time favorite,"These Crocs Flip Flops are the most comfortable, quality pair of flip flops I've ever owned! I love my Crocs flip flops more than I can probably fully explain on here. I wear them all day every day when the weather is appropriate outside. But even when it's not weather appropriate, I wear them around the house. I take off whatever shoes I was wearing outside to put them on as soon as I come inside. I'm on my second pair of this particular flip flop. The last one I wore non-stop for over three years, possibly closer to four. I'm very happy with the length of time they lasted. These Flip Flops are made of extremely durable material. I'm never worried about stepping on something that will go through my shoe, or about them failing me and tearing. And the bottom of the flip flop provides a good amount of traction in case of walking in wet situations. But most importantly of all, they are the most comfortable shoes I own - yes, of all of my shoes, even my expensive name brand shoes - these are my comfortable go to shoes. If my feet are hurting after a long day of walking in other shoes - I want my flip flops. Style wise they are very mild for what I consider to be ""larger"" flip flops - not at all clunky. They come in a great variety of colors (my current pair is black, but I'm thinking of getting a bright purple pair just for fun.) There is no better pair of flip flops you are going to find for the price. I highly, highly recommend these to anyone who wants a comfortable, durable pair or flip flops."

So, in the interest of color diversification, I bought a couple of these in the same size 8.  My first thought was that they look like pontoon boats on my feet! LOL  I'm assuming that, since they are ""unisex"" they are wider than the normal Medium width to which I'm accustomed in the Kadee IIs.  So, they are definitely not sexy; however, living in a rural desert region with rocks and gravel pretty much everywhere - even in town - I do find that the wider width gives my foot a little bigger platform and keeps it a bit further away from the rocks and sand.  The length seems to be good - not too long - so I don't think a smaller size would work for me.  All in all, I do recommend these.  Just know that they are sized wider than some of the other style of Crocs and plan accordingly.

I could not find them in the store, where I purchased my original pair, so I turned to Amazon to assist in my search. I was ecstatic when I found them. I live in these sandals! They are the most comfortable flip flops I've ever worn. After breaking my foot 4 years ago, my doctor advised me that flip flops were not good support for my feet. But these Crocs, in my opinion, offer good support and no cause me no pain, whereas the cheaper flimsy pairs I had previously always worn, did. I highly recommend these flip flops."

Quality seems to be good as I chose them because of the well known name & time around. While I never undertand how so many people said Croc shoes were so comfortable as to my they always felt hard as a rock when I tried them on. But I bought these flip flops for shower shoes, and they get the job done. They look decent enough in that aspect, but I’m going off their reputation for quality. I will post later on that regard. I took off a star because the plastic piece that goes between your toes cut me! So will keep a eye on that. Also mine came with a chemical smell to them. At least I knew they were new right?"

They are very cushiony on my feet, the thong portion between the toes does not rub or bother my toes at all. They are great in rain, dry quickly, last through years of wear and are easy to clean. I have not yet found a flip flop as comfy and useful as this one. I have many colours of these but the peach colour I just bought is really nice. My daughter has commented on the cute colour about 5 times since they arrived a week ago! Delivery was prompt."

They are super durable. A pair I've had for at least 7 years (maybe 10, can't recall just when I purchased them) finally busted. I've never had any shoe of this type last that long. I can wear these for all day walking excursions with no issues at all. I can throw them in the washing machine or dishwasher when dirty and they come out looking like new. I did have to  return them for a bigger size. My old pair were 9's and fit fine, but these were just too short. Croc's are annoying in that you never know if you need to order up, down, or exact. Apparently one needs to size up now for this particular model."

I think because they are unisex they run a little big and wide.  I purchased the women's size 9 but I could have worn the size 9.  No big deal though they are so comfortable and the arch support is perfect.  Highly recommend and will be purchasing another pair.

Some of the reviews I read complained that Croc shrunk the size a little. Others said they fit just fine. I decided to hope mine would fit fine. But they didn't. When I compared them to the previous pair of Croc flip flops that I am replacing, the foot bed, or the sole of the shoe, is exactly the same size. But the tongue, or thong piece that goes between the toes, is 1/4 inch shorter on the new ones. (Size 10w 8m) That's enough to make the top part of the flip flop pinch my toe. So there isn't enough clearance for my foot to fit. Even if I stick with the Croc brand, I guess I'm going to have to try them in person before buying."

These are great because they look just like regular cheap flip flops from the top, are very lightweight, and have great support. I loved them so much I've already worn them 3x despite it only being about 50 degrees outside! Also, they seem like they will hold up well over time (typical of my experience with crocs they are built to last). I hope to buy these in more colors in the future!"

I can wear these all day walking and my feet and legs never hurt.  I hope Crocs will bring back the quality they once had.  If not, I'm switching to another brand. UPDATE:  These Crocs have completely broken (the part between the toes).  I only wear these as my house slippers.  These shoes should last almost forever like my other Crocs. The unisex style is more for wide feet, and my feet are medium width.  Crocs no longer have any quality and I do not recommend these flip flops."

I reordered a smaller size &  am returning this pair.  I wish they hadn’t changed the width as I have a wider foot.  These are now more tapered & fitted to the average foot width.

I don't wear any of them. Crocs can easily last well over a year and that is with almost daily wear. So comfortable and they can take a beating. Tip-don't leave them in the sun. 100 degree weather and they curled up and shrunk. Still usable and better than others. I like them so much, I put them in the truck for after golf or rock climbing flippers. Amazing price point and by far the best flip flops."

They have some type of soft foam flex insole and the other ones we bought last year have a sort of ball massaging insole so walking around disney was easier then without them.

I had bought them to use just at the pool, but on a whim I wore them on a long walk with my dog. They held up perfectly! They were comfortable for the entire hour I wore them, with no rubbing between the toes. They also were easy to walk in, and didn't threaten to slip off like other flip flops sometimes do, even when they got wet from walking in damp grass. I even ran in them, and while running in flip flops is obviously a dumb idea, they stayed on perfectly. I said I could only comfortably wear them for a couple hours because I have weird feet and need inserts, which obviously isn't an option with flip flops. I'm guessing they'd be comfortable all day for an average person. As to fit, my feet are an average width, and my normal size fit perfectly. They extend beyond the edges of my feet a bit, as flip flops should - otherwise you can end up stubbing your toe or the side of your foot."

Standing and walking all day at work and Crocs are kind to my feet. These Mary Jane's are not bad. Like most Crocs, they are snug when new. With my experience, these will mold to my foot in no time. However, they sit on the joint of my big toe. I hope this isn't a problem after they are well broke in. I have a bunion on my right foot. These sit DIRECTLY on it. The picture attached shows the Mary Janes on right and the Jayna slingback on left. (I have 4 pair of Jayna!!!)  You can see that the Jayna comes higher on the foot, missing the bunion area. I hit the new Mary Jane's with a hair dryer for a minute, put on a pair of socks, as thick as I could stand, and walked around the house an hour or so. This loosened them up to a nice comfortable level. I still don't know if I can wear them when my bunion flares up. I like the bottom, much more traction than the Jayna. Cute shoes and I'm happy enough to keep them. I am a size 10 and order 10. Fits snug but loosens up with wear."

I was wearing Converse style shoes and was looking for something more comfortable. After wearing these Crocs for one day my feet were in more pain than ever and I thought, it must just be the cumulation of the week's work. I wore them again another day and the pain was unbearable. After I got off work, I took them off to walk to my car and had instant relief. Haven't worn them since. I don't have narrow or wide feet, these shoes were the perfect fit, but hurt my feet like crazy! I've since been wearing a different kind of Crocs and they've been wonderful. Maybe it's different if you have narrow feet? But please! If you have regular sized feet, don't get these shoes! They're cute, but man do that eat you feet up.

I wore these shoes roughly 20 days in the 2 months I had them.... I fast pace walked (lugging all my school and work stuff for the day) from my car to catch the Green Line in Mpls and both straps pulled away! I had to shuffle and hardly walk the rest of the day. What else am I supposed to do?! Shoes should last YEARS! Amazon and this company only covers a 1 month return/exchange policy. I searched for a way to contact Amazon through all the links but even the link for defective went straight to a page that said the purchase was over 30 days. I can see this policy for general but if a product breaks after a short use and could be defective and the rubber is weak in this pair of shoes then it should be exchangeable. IF they had a 6 month exchange policy for defects I would purchase these again but because they don't stand behind this product longer than 30 days I will not be purchasing it again. Sadly, because this could have been a fluke and maybe not happen to all of this type of shoe. Just beware that normal wearing for 2 months could cause your strap (s) to pull away and rip off. In general these are comfortable and I LOVED wearing them to work. :("

Non slip shoes are generally clunky and so ugly, but these are cute and uber lightweight. They are open on the top, so be cautious of that if you're going to be around hot or sharp things. If you do get them wet on the inside, it is easy to dry since they are water resistant croc material. I ordered a 6 and they are true to size. I've had this pair for almost 2 years now and they're still holding up, although the bottom sole is just now starting to peel off. Walking around in degreaser will do that! I'll definitely reorder them as long as I continue my serving career."

I have the leopard crocs in size 9 W and they are really super large, I only wear them at home because they slip off my foot at each step. I then decided to order these in 9 regular thinking the strap would hold my feet down. Well first they came in 9W. Secondly, and this is the weirdest part, they are so narrow and small I can barely fit my feet in them let alone walk comfortably in them. The shape is also particularly weird, mine came so curved up on the toes they look like Aladin's shoes... And no shoe box, they were just wrapped in a plastic bag. It seems like there's a real inconsistency problem with the sizing, it really makes you wonder if some of them are not counterfeits. On the bright side they were delivered in less than 48 hours."

The first time I ordered them they were absolutely amazing and fulfilled my slight obsession with Mary Jane flats. I have to wear nonslip shoes for work and these were wonderful. I wore the first pair down in a year. I went to buy a second pair to replace my old worn out ones and although I ordered the same size as the first pair, they were significantly smaller!! I thought maybe I just had to break them in but that wasn’t the case, they were just smaller in general. Very strange and unfortunate. I loved the first pair but the second was a waste of my money.

I read reviews on how they can have an embarrassing ""squelch"" sound, but I wore them a couple of times for more than 8 hours with no problems.  The weather was less than 70 degrees so maybe I didn't get sweaty feet. The heel did not give me blisters like I thought they might, especially since I am usually a 7.5 -8 and had to get the 7, since the 8 was too big. So far this seems like a great purchase."

Only thing negative to say about them is the breaking in process. The first few times wearing them is rough! I ended up with bleeding blisters on my heels after a few high velocity shifts.

I purchased what I thought would be comfortable shoes to wear in the kitchen, but I was crippled by the end of the day, on two separate days. I took them back and came to dependable Amazon, and purchased these shoes. They were immediately comfortable, acceptable in a professional kitchen, and seem to be holding up pretty well. They are very easy to keep clean. I just wipe them with a damp cloth. I wear black socks with them for added comfort and class requirements (to not have bare feet). I'm really happy with these shoes. They are a bit loose, which I expected, and helps at the end of the night with my tired (and sometimes slightly swollen) feet.

I have worn different models of crocs around the house for years and never experienced discomfort or pain after standing or walking in them for extended periods which is why I picked crocs as work shoes. My feet are neither particularly narrow nor wide and I have no special concerns or problems a shoe needs to allow for. When this model arrived and I tried them on I worried that their relatively narrow sole design and rounded heel part might feel wobbly and wear me out after a few hours on the job. Still , they felt comfortable when I tried them on so I wore them to work. After about four hours in them my feet began to seriously hurt and by the end of my shift the pain had extended up my lower legs which felt heavy and tense. Three stars because they look super cute, are well made, light weight and - for short periods outside of work - comfy. Sadly not suitable as work shoes for me"

These are a basic black flat with the nice cushy crocs feel.  I like the strap across the top because it keeps my feet completely planted in the shoe with no slipping.  These do have the suction sound issue I've had with a few other crocs.  Where your feet make some weird and uncomfortable noises while you walk without socks.  I find this problem usually goes away once the shoes are broken in.  I've been wearing them with a pair of no-show socks until then because the sock keeps the noises from happening.

They fit a little larger than the same size of black ones that I bought from a local store, but I actually was okay with that because the black ones were almost too tight and I don't want to spend all day at clinical in tight shoes. They are also of a slightly softer/more pliable material than the black ones, but they have the stamped logo and log buttons in the correct places, so I am sure they are not knockoffs.

I had the Crocs Kadee flat in size 10 and they were snug fitting so I ordered the 10 in the Alice flat and to my surprise they are very loose. The backs almost slip off when I walk and the strap doesn't do anything to help. My feet are wide and I've been wearing wide toe box Altras to work for years. These flats are way wider than I expected too! The heel has a weird unstable feeling to it, maybe just because I live in wide, flat running shoes or flip flops but I'm not sure I could wear these to work if I am on my feet all day. I plan to keep them for days when I need to dress things up a bit but the size 10 fits me more like an 11. Too bad there are no 1/2 sizes."

This particular 'Alice' style really appeals to me because I wear my croc flats with dresses and skirts 99% of the time. But these hurt my feet the second I put them on. They run narrow and the toe bed sits right on the big toe join- where most folks have their bunion issues. The strap was also a little small and pressed into my feet- which I know would be a major issue after walking all day at Disney. I had to return these. Super disappointing!

But these shoes were were labeled 8W (the only ones offered in a wide width) so I thought I was safe. I WASN'T. They were normal width and my toes were cramped. My feet swelled up in just 1 day of wearing them, even though I slipped them off every chance I got.

My feet don't feel squished in them like a lot of shoes do, as if feet are supposed to be extremely narrow. Feet are your base, they're meant to be wide. These shoes were almost perfect. The thing that gives them a 3 star is the strap. That strap is not big enough for my feet, and it's very uncomfortable. Are feet supposed to be flat? Why is the strap so short? This thing will snap off in no time, and because there's plenty of room for my feet, these won't stay on without a strap. So, mixed feelings about them. 3 stars."

My feet got super sweaty (had to wear tights as uniform so no absorbency) and the natural law of body functioning occurred.  Would 100% buy again, these are the best work shoes.  Only cons: if you work in cold weather and have to wear tights likes me your feet will freeze.  Also, best way to wash them is throw them in the washer with your clothes but DON'T DRY.  My husband threw these guys in the dryer and they both shrunk and cracked.  Ruined.  I cried."
Crocs,Women's Sloane Slide,B07DLSH6B7,R2JGI1HJUK8CEL,"June 18, 2019",5,Cushy. Comfy. Run a little big? Check the EU sizes.,"Ok for all you 7.5 sisters. Im a 7.5 and I usually can't fit into 7's, while 8's are exclusively too big. So this sandal did fit me OK as a 7. I ran into the Croc store at my mall before I ordered this and noticed that their sizes do tend to run a little big in terms of the EU to US chart. (For example a size 7 is typically a EU 36-37 but these size 7's are EU 37-38) I usually wear an EU 38 but I can usually cram my feet into a 37 and have an ok day if I'm out on a date in fancy 37 shoes.  So I switched out my cart from a 8 to a 7 and ordered them.  They fit!!  As far as the width goes, I dont usually encounter problems with my shoes being too narrow but these came marked with a capital W.  The width feels fine just a normal shoe to me. But I guess Wide wouldnt hurt here as it can help you push your feet in deeper to get a better grip on your sandals.  It might be a smudge too small but nothting you would notice if you are wearing them for a quick errend in town or around the house. And you can always adjust by pushing your feet a little farther in. They are cushy and comfy and I really like them. And they dont have those henious under the toe grooves that most of their sandals seem to have.  I'm a dancer so I'm really particular about my shoes and feet and I hate shoes that are too big, too heavy, or limit movement in the ankle.  These are perfect for me and I love pastels."
Crocs,Women's Sloane Slide,B07DLSH6B7,R3BAX3KND77TQ5,"April 7, 2019",5,Size down,I typically wear an 8 and had to size down to a 7 in these. They are pretty comfortable and I like that they don’t have that raised/indent thing by the toes like a lot of sandal this style have. I also like that there are no logos in your face.

They are very comfortable & stay on your feet good.  If you wear a narrow width though they may be too wide.  I usually wear a med. to wide width depending on the shoe.  These didn't specify what the width was though it feels like a med. width to me.  I bought the white ones & thinking about buying the black ones also.

My best friend had always raved about crocs so I figured I would give these a try. I have yet to trip, or have the front of the sandal fold under itself. They’re comfortable and fit as expected. They’re incredibly easy to clean and have great grip on the bottom. I’ll be buying these in the future."

Crocs,Women's Sloane Slide,B07DLSH6B7,R315R04BHI0PMP,"July 20, 2019",5,My Favorite Slides EVER,"I wear slide sandals around my house 24/7 (I have hardwood floors and hate the feeling of my feet being ""dirty""). I have gone through a couple of pairs from other retailers and while they have been nice, they are NOTHING in comparison to these Croc ones! First of all, I love Crocs and think they are super comfortable, so I'm already a believer. But when these arrived and I put them on, I felt like I was putting squishy clouds on my feet. They are SO comfortable and fit my feet perfectly. I normally wear a 6 in Crocs and ordered a 6 in these--perfect fit with little extra room if I did want to wear socks with them. For those who don't own Crocs, I would recommend sizing down half a size from your regular shoe size. I normally wear a 6.5 in almost every other shoe brand, but a 6 in Crocs."
Crocs,Women's Sloane Slide,B07DLSH6B7,R22MX0MMDGRL86,"August 23, 2019",2,same material?,"I love my traditional crocs, so when I saw it in a slide I was all about it. Tried them around the house and super comfy, all good.  The first time to the outdoor pool, however, changed everything.  While swimming, the slides were on deck in the sun.  They literally shrunk and got distorted. Plus they were super hot, too hot to put on.  Now they are too small and uncomfortable; useless.  Buyer beware:  maybe good for around the house, or the gym, but not for outdoor pool time in the sun! Makes me wonder if they are REAL crocs, or perhaps knock offs. Very disappointed."
Crocs,Women's Sloane Slide,B07DLSH6B7,R1TSY2BIAZSM41,"June 14, 2019",5,Size runs big,I have come to love all styles of crocs. Although I am always uncertain what size to order. I normally wear a size 7 1/2. Per recommendation I sized up to an 8. They were way too big. So I returned them and ordered a size 7 and they fit perfect. They fit somewhat wide. I consider these my summer house shoes so I’ve only worn them around the house. I’m not sure this style would be comfortable wearing to an all day excursion.  There doesn’t seem to be much arch support as they are a flatter style shoe. I am 50 yrs old and they are perfect for my at home shoe. Would be great for kids or younger adults.
Crocs,Women's Sloane Slide,B07DLSH6B7,R2L8CZ1V7ZY5WP,"June 18, 2019",3,Pidgeon toe shoes.,My only real disappointment is that these shoes seem to be made for people with pigeon toes. Unfortunately I can't wear them because of the curvature of the shoes. The last picture above is how they look when I switch left and right shoes on my feet...looks better but not comfortable to wear so I can't use them. Unfortunately I didn't discover the problem until it was too late to return them.
Crocs,Women's Sloane Slide,B07DLSH6B7,RPL0ZNPCOBJKH,"June 19, 2019",2,Will not stay square on feet!,"These sandals would be great except for two issues: 1. They twist on your feet, so will not stay straight and in line with your steps 2. The footbed is textured, and is uncomfortable on bare feet I would not buy again!"
Crocs,Women's Sloane Slide,B07DLSH6B7,R2ZLBKVU3W45FQ,"November 15, 2019",3,"Wanted to love, wish I'd gotten something else","These are acceptable for running outside quickly, but they have some drawbacks and I'll probably have to replace them. I was excited about these shoes, but they are a bit snug around the foot and yet don't feel secure. They fit a bit more forward on the foot than I am used to in a slide (typically I use Adidas adissage). So, all at once they both feel tight and like they're going to come off.  They also tend to ride out to the side and sit at a cocked angle under the heel. So, after walking a hundred feet or so, I have to adjust my foot or be walking half on the edge of the shoe/half in the dirt. I really wanted them to work. Unfortunately the postage to return would not make it worth it to do so. Therefore, I'm going to use them until I find a better alternative and just have to eat the cost."
Crocs,Women's Sloane Slide,B07DLSH6B7,R2Z6SGGTOEYD8V,"August 2, 2019",5,I have put miles on these shoes,These are comfortable for doing chores and house work.  We have hard floors and I have to have something cushy to protect my feet.  Not a lot of arch support is my only negative thought.  They hose off nicely.  I wear size 8.5 W so ordered a 9.  Fits fine barefoot.  A bit narrow if I still have socks on from the barn.
Crocs,Women's Sloane Slide,B07DLSH6B7,R11OBJS1VRDRH6,"May 29, 2019",5,Love these!,"I was looking for sandals to wear on the pool deck to swim practice, and Crocs are perfect! I didn't want anything between my toes, I didn't want ""massagers"" under my feet, and I didn't want fabric across the instep because it starts to smell when you get it wet. These Crocs are perfect. The only thing I'd change if i could is that the piece over the instep is very shallow....I could use a little more room."
Crocs,Women's Sloane Slide,B07DLSH6B7,R1TQ58W1TA6HOB,"June 4, 2019",2,Flimsy & Big,I bought these for a cruise and they seem inadequate.  I bought Crocs before and loved their sturdiness.  These seemed very flimsy and they were huge - so big I have to return them.  Very disappointed.
Crocs,Women's Sloane Slide,B07DLSH6B7,R31Y1R66S4OX38,"May 21, 2019",5,Comfy and Convenient,I usually wear a wide shoe so these were a little snug when I first got them but they are now just so comfortable.

Crocs,Women's Sloane Slide,B07DLSH6B7,R3Q8Q1AVNT6L6J,"November 9, 2019",5,Perfect For My Needs!,"Finally! I have an aversion to cloth slippers because I was forever replacing them when they got stretched out and dirty. I looked high and low for some kind of slide that was comparable to the Crocs flip flops I wear as a slipper substitute in summer. I needed something that could be worn over socks and would hold up on my daily outside trips to the mailbox. Had no idea that Crocs made slides but when I found them, I ordered immediately. They were reasonably priced, will be long lasting, fit perfectly, can be worn outdoors and then thrown in a sudsy bath if they get dirty.  What's not to love?"

Achilles tendonitis to be exact. In the past I have had planter facilities, just need to stretch to cure that. I walk up to 5 miles a day on concrete in the operating room. Im old and I hurt. I have always worn ugly crocs but spent money to venture in tennis shoes. Always go back to crocs. Especially now, nothing can touch the back of my heel so there are not many options. I have a wide foot but crocs were still a bit floppy. These shoes fit more around the foot where you slide your foot in but the toe box is bigger but not as big as a usual croc and not as small as crocs sloane. The extra cushion has just saved me life. WOW what a difference this extra cushion makes!! And the heel cup is deeper so they are not as floppy but the back is not high enough to hit my injured achilles area. I never wear the stap behind my heel and with the velcro I can remove it. I also think they look better than regular crocs. I hope they come out with more color. I highly recommend these shoes!!!! I just tried them on after a long day and my feet hurt, but these really take the pressure off. Just unbelievable...question is how long will they last before I need a new pair...."
Crocs,Women's Bistro Pro Literide Clog,B07CN8YZ7T,RSCOW157TAQUP,"February 9, 2019",5,Great slip on shoe,"Up to now I have purchased three pairs of rubber shoes to slip on when I want to take the dogs out or just flop around the house.  The previous pairs have all been under 20 dollars and the biggest reason I wanted to try the crocs was because it looked like it had a more substantial sole.  I have a ton of trees in my yard, and the previous pairs were all easily punctured by sticks on the ground.  The crocs so far have been very solid.  While not as sturdy as a hiking boot, they have a much more substantial sole and I have had no issue so far.  They are also very comfortable and I like the option to keep the ankle strap up for easy on/off options or to place it on the ankle for a more secure fit while outside.  Well worth the extra money."

This pair, because of the raised footbed, caused my upper foot to rub against the upper lip causing chafing and blisters on my upper foot.  That lack of holes on the side also caused my feet to sweat.  Unlike other Crocs, I was not able to wear these for any prolong period of time.  I returned them."
Crocs,Women's Bistro Pro Literide Clog,B07CN8YZ7T,RQYFAW438HBJ4,"June 16, 2019",5,Nice on the Feet in the Kitchen,I bought these to wear while cooking.  They arrived on time and in perfect condition. They are very durable. I expect years of use. You will have to wear socks to avoid wear blisters. I got one trying to get by barefooted. But it is something easily avoided with socks. The arch support is good.  These have no holes as is common in other models.  This makes them good protective wear when dealing with scalding spillage.

This is my 2nd pair and the first lasted over a year.  I could have kept wearing them, but it was time for a new foot bed for support.  This has an upgraded footbed from my first pair and is very comfortable.  These take a lot of abuse, spills, etc. and clean up great.  No problems with slipping either.  I've paid nearly $200 for other shoes and have tried about everything.  These by far have been the best shoe for me.  I have a wider, flat foot and these help me get through my shifts.  I will not wear anything else now.  I even gave a pair to one of my young co-workers and she loves them as well.  It's all she wears for work.  I'm 60 and am thankful to have discovered this shoe."

They were still in pretty good shape, but I have a better job now and I wanted to get a fresh pair. I decided to go with these and I'm SO HAPPY I did! The LiteRide insoles are top notch! I like the velcro in the back to adjust how tight I need them. These are the Cadillac of Crocs!"

Ordered these and some filas from amazon too.. just in case they sucked. Its only been a few days but OMG theyre amazing! I have more energy, my feet are not swollen at the end of my shifts, and theyre comfortable as hell! My feet can breathe, dont have to be concern about tying my shoes during a rush/or ignoring them being untied to push out a rush.And theyre easy to  clean. I will buy again when these start to get worn. Best kitchen shoes Ive had so far and they were only 30 bucks. (Ive owned $200 mozos) I 10 for 10 recommend if you are diabetic like me or simply have had feet issues/work long hours in the kitchen."

They are SOOO squishy & comfortable! I have Peripheral Neuropathy & other foot/ankle/lower calf issues. When I say that these are literally the only shoes that I can wear, I mean I wear them 24/7, 365 days of the year! They are a lifesaver for my medical issues! I seriously don’t know what I would do without them! The Bistro Pro Crocs line is a true Blessing in my life already! Sadly I’ve tried many different kinds of shoes to no avail! So while the ‘look’ of the shoes is not my druther, I’m just grateful I have shoes that I can actually walk in!"

Crocs,Women's Bistro Pro Literide Clog,B07CN8YZ7T,R3I37TEWMLNHGR,"February 1, 2020",5,Perfect comfort for long shifts!!,I work Vet med ER and these shoes are perfect. The orange foam is very bouyant and forgiving with the relentless up and down and movements of the job. My feet don't feel tired nor do the hurt. The Velcro is awesome! No need to worry about my foot sliding out of my shoes. I honestly want to find regular lay person shoes like these so I can wear them everyday theyre so comfortable!! My cons per say are that the Velcro on the back of the shoe squeaks and crackles too much and occasionally is rubbs my ankle wrong. It doesn't happen often. && the shoes don't breathe well. My feet stink and sweat often through my shifts.
Crocs,Women's Bistro Pro Literide Clog,B07CN8YZ7T,RK0TYX8AX2SKN,"August 24, 2019",5,Totally worth it,"I finally bought these upon recommendation of some of my coworkers and I love them. They fit really well, not too tight or too loose. Mine are slightly right across the top of my foot but that doesn’t bother me since I don’t wear the strap around my ankle. I haven’t had any issues with slipping or sliding in the kitchen. I only wish there was more arch support, but other than that, they’re very comfortable and I’m happy with my purchase."

I might as well have worn flats in the yard.  Plus they gave me blisters.  I'm sure I should be wearing socks with these, but that was what I wanted to avoid.  They're ok.

The additional foaming bad inside only provides additional comfort which comes in handy since I'm on my feet during my duration at work. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something that is not only comfy but easy to put on and take off.

Crocs,Women's Jaunt Shorty Boot,B00DU93UTQ,RMMJERS2X7RMO,"October 2, 2015",2,So weird,"What an odd boot.  I'm an 8.5-9, so I ordered the 9, given that others said it ran big. Now, I have pretty standard, normal feet and ankles and don't really ever have a problem with shoes fitting properly, but these things were tight to get on, and then once on, it was rather tight around the top of the foot near the ankle around to the heel, to the point that on one of my feet, every time I took a step, air from inside got pushed out through the tight-fitting area and made a delightful fart-style noise. Meanwhile, I could have shoved a wad of rolled up newspaper into the toe box and still would have had room to wiggle my toes. So these were paradoxically both too small and too large at the same time. Plus the color was less ""Raspberry"" and more ""Bright!!! Pink!!!"". If it was life or death, need a boot, I could have managed. But I'm sure I can find something better. So they're going back."
Crocs,Women's Jaunt Shorty Boot,B00DU93UTQ,RN0CUBHDATQA4,"April 25, 2016",5,Get these boots! You wont regret it!,"I love my new boots! I've been wearing them for hours now walking around and they are very comfortable! No problem with them rubbing against my shin or being too tight. ORDER YOUR NUMBER SIZE!!!! For instance I wear a 7 1/2 in just about any shoe so I ordered both a 7 and a 8 just to be sure. The 7 fit me like Cinderellas slipper. Perfect! My foot was swimming in the 8. Way too big. (Also remember that these are crocs so they are made wide. Don't buy big or you'll look like your wearing flippers) So if you are a 7 or 7 1/2, get a size 7. 8 to 8 1/2 I'd say it's about the same so get a size 8. These are super lightweight just as any Crocs shoe. There is some nice arch supposed going on. Not flat. And I literally just stood in a shallow pool of water (testing them out), these babies are indeed waterproof. Although, I do worry a little about the big open circles on each side. Hopefully they do well in the rain as I do use public transportation often to cummute to and from. Also, there is plenty of room to tuck your pants into the boot. Don't mind my sweats! It's laundry day!"
Crocs,Women's Jaunt Shorty Boot,B00DU93UTQ,R27Q3LFKDO83AV,"August 3, 2017",4,More durable than other similarly priced boots. Ordering a replacement pair after over a year of hard use.,"These are the best inexpensive boots for gardening and goat wrangling that I've found so far. I wear them daily---usually most of the day on the weekends---and they have lasted over a year. These boots are so lightweight and inexpensive that I expected they'd come apart like most similar boots have for me---I spend a lot of time squatting to garden, causing a sharp ankle crease that usually quickly falls apart on most boots, with the upper separating from the sole. Not with these boots, though! I don't even see evidence of that crease. They are as comfortable as any other boot like this that I've tried. Cool feet is not a thing I expect from a boot that's actually protecting my feet from all the stuff I might run into while working with my goats and my land. After about 11 months, I started to notice a piece of one of the soles peeling off. It didn't really affect the wearing of the shoe, but sometimes I'd get hay or grass clippings stuck in the sole because of it. The only thing that I found odd/annoying about these is that the white rings around the holes on the sides are separate pieces that are not attached to the rest of the boot with seams, stitching, or glue of any kind. If you actually use those holes to pull the boots on or off, the rings have a tendency to pop out. Eventually I just left them off. A word of warning, though: Don't leave these boots sitting out in harsh, hot sunlight all day. One morning earlier this week, I left these all day on my back deck (southwest exposure) because they were covered with wet grass clippings I didn't want to track inside. The next morning, I could barely get them on my feet and they felt weird. They shrunk/warped in the sun/heat---the soles are kind of weirdly round/bulbous now, and the white bit around the attachment from upper-to-sole came loose. Lesson learned. I recently bought some Sloggers clogs as a replacement (because one of the soles had developed that flap), and they are fine for taking the compost out or whatever. But I realized I want my whole foot and ankle covered when I'm doing most stuff outside. So I'm ordering another pair of these boots."

I liked the style and price of these boots so I decided to give it a try.  Everyone said they run large so I started to look for what size to buy in the question/comment section.  I am an 8.5 and everyone who has the same size said to buy the 8.  Okay great.  They arrived and I went to slip on these bad boys and I immediately regretted it.  My 10 year old daughter laughed hysterically as I attempted to remove them from my feet.  I finally got them off am sending them back.  I am going to try a size 9.

I liked that they were supportive but were a single piece so I could hose them off easily and not have to worry about messing up an insole like most of ""rain boots"". The fit for the foot was good but the ankle was awkwardly tight and kind of rubbed. I do not have big ankles so I was very surprised but I did remember reading a similar review.

Edited!!!,"I had previously purchased 2 other pairs of a similar style boot from Crocs and wore them to death.  They no longer make that style and so I took a chance on these.  Initially, I was afraid they would rub my ankles as the plastic material is much heavier than the previous model and they fit tight at the ankle.  I found that the sizing was truer on these and although so far I've only worn them once, it was for a couple hours cleaning horse stalls, feeding, turning out and slogging through mud, etc.  They felt great and I expect them to last even longer than the others.  This is my third pair of Croc boots and for farm chores they can't be beat.  I wear them except on the hottest and coldest days.  I'll continue to buy when this pair bites the dust. UPDATE:  Should have waited and worn them again.  They DO rub my skinny, bony ankles bloody!  I really love them but will have to return because of the weird fit. UPDATE: Ok, so in desperation, I ""modified"" the ankle area (see pic) where they were rubbing.  I really needed them and already threw my old ones away.  I'm back to loving them again...."
Crocs,Women's Jaunt Shorty Boot,B00DU93UTQ,RF4HQROELOR1M,"May 2, 2018",5,Terrific little mudders AND NOW SNOW BOOTS!,"These little beauties are perfect for me. So far, I use them only on pasture visits. I added an old pair of insoles and made them better yet. I like the short height and the absolute ease of putting on and taking off. I can do either without using my hands! Sizing with Crocs is, to me at least, a little tricky. Since I normally wear an 8 or 8 1/2 in shoes and boots, I was 'advised' per the Crocs sizing thing, to get a 9. Boy am I glad I didn't. The W8 is perfect with or without mid-weight socks. I'd be swimming in a 9. Short of leaving these in the sun (no, no, no!), I expect to get many years of use from them. If they surprise me and suddenly fall apart, I will update my rating and review. For now, I love my Crocs! Update 2/27/19 - I still love them but I'll be darned if they haven't shrunk. In a closet! No sun involved. What the heck? I can still wear them but hands are involved, especially when taking them off. And the insoles had to go. Still, I'd buy again BUT IN THE LARGER SIZE."

I have the skinniest of ankles - not enough to prevent these boots from slicing like daggers into the bone. Thought I could remedy this by wearing thick socks, but, to my dismay, I learned that wearing a thicker sock makes it difficult to shove your foot through the narrow ankle opening (again, I have narrow feet). In heavy rains water pours right into the top of the bootie, which is inexplicably wide. Sadly, my love for Crocs has been waning recently due to sizing inconsistencies and major design flaws such as these."
Crocs,Women's Jaunt Shorty Boot,B00DU93UTQ,R2WD08J0OMHFY9,"April 16, 2019",4,Great product but beware of sizing,"Im going to write mostly on the fit because it might help some in making there decision, these boots defiantly run on the smaller side, for me I wear an 11 that are usually always a bit roomy for me which Ive become accustom to liking the bit of extra room.  I can sometimes also fit into a 10 1/2.  I Ordered the 11w on accident, but I never mind the extra width, I have few shoes that are 11w but most of my shoes are regular 11s.  The width was just a bit snug, and I tried them on barefoot,walked around for 20 min and wondered what it would feel like with socks on because it was already at its limit of snugness I wondered was this snugness going to start hurting after a couple hours of work.  I ordeded these to be the perfect shoe in my garden I have a huge garden and greenhouse this year,I live in Oregon where lots of April showers really bring may flowers, true, its pretty rainy here in the spring, so I walk through lots of mud in my garden this time of year and some areas thick mud.  these shoes would have been perfect for all of it but too snug of a fit for me.  I Do wonder however how long they would last mayb only a couple years for me since I do heavy duty gardening.  also I do remember where someone had cut a hole to get that bit of extra comfort they needed, For me it wouldn't have worked I will have to return these boots and hunt for something else."

They fit perfect and are extremely comfortable.  I wanted a mid height rain type boot I can walk the lawn with and these fit the bill.  They are quick to put on and pull off.  They look neutral enough to be men's boots as well.  I primarily use when/after it rains or early in the morning when the ground is wet.

Crocs,Women's Jaunt Shorty Boot,B00DU93UTQ,R2WU0KA02AOFEE,"January 13, 2016",3,To Goodwill!,"They are so stiff and narrow at the ankle area. It rubs against the bone that stick out on the inner ankle and walking down the stairs is difficult because the rim part hits your shin when you go down or bend. For the rubbing, thick socks help a little, but that makes it too snug. Wish I got them a size up or had an idea how stiff they were. Though I have to say, they are good for wide feet, and the colors a pretty pink. Anyways, can't return them, I've cut off the tag. To Goodwill they go!"
Crocs,Women's Jaunt Shorty Boot,B00DU93UTQ,R1QH85E37KYAIJ,"July 17, 2018",2,Fell apart in under a year’s light use,"I don’t give negative reviews; I tend to keep my thoughts to myself if I don’t like a product. However, this is a poorly made product, so buyers need to be informed.  I am disappointed because I gave them a chance and they’re falling apart after minimal wear. As reviewers have mentioned, they are stiff and uncomfortable, they squeak or make suction sounds to your feet when you walk, and they do pull socks down inside the boot. However, I dealt with all of that without a complaint, but now the bottom strip on the bottom outside of the boot is falling off and flapping as I walk in less than a year’s light wear."
Crocs,Women's Jaunt Shorty Boot,B00DU93UTQ,R2GYSD1W08K5UH,"May 20, 2018",3,Not sure,"The product came quickly, which I appreciated since we've been getting a lot of rain the last few days. I liked how they're truly waterproof and I felt my feet and ankles were completely protected from the rain. They are a comfortable fit around the toes. Unfortunately, the boot does rub hard against my ankles to where I was really sore at the end of the day. I see other reviewers have posted about bruises they've gotten on their ankles. I'm not sure if this will be solved or if it's a risk I have to take every time I wear the boots. Also, after just one day of wearing them, I feel the bottoms are pretty worn down. This worries me because I feel like I'll run out of grip after only a couple wears, which would make this extremely dangerous to wear in the rain. Not sure if I would recommend, don't think I would buy again."
Crocs,Women's Jaunt Shorty Boot,B00DU93UTQ,R2DWANT5OKR62W,"May 8, 2019",5,These are so fun and cute,"I am a professional photographer who shoots primarily wildlife and show dogs (yes, that's a strange combo...I know).  I find myself slopping around in muddy conditions more than I can say.  I've trashed numerous decent shoes while doing this.  So these funny and fun looking rubber boots attracted me from the start. Since I haven't had these boots for long, my review will be based strictly on sizing and comfort.  I can't yet attest to the durability. In ""normal"" shoes, I wear either an 8 1/2 or a 9 depending on how the shoe runs (big or small).  But I would say that most of my shoes are 8 1/2's.  I ordered these in size 9 in black.  My feet are a normal width, not wide, not narrow.  But what usually gets me  into trouble with any boot is my insanely high arches and instep...I mean INSANELY high.  Could I even get my foot into these things?  The short and surprising answer is YES!  They went on and came off so easily!  Surprise surprise! I would say the fit is perfect for me without socks and they feel great that way, but as a couple of other reviewers stated, since there is no way for air to escape when you walk (which is the whole purpose of the boot..no air or mud in or out) there is a farting sound that occurs with each stride.  Some might find it embarrassing, but I find it pretty funny for some reason (no, I'm NOT nuts.  Or at least that's what they tell me).  With socks, the farting  noise disappears completely.  For me the fit is best with thin socks.  Thick socks will make the boots too tight around my Everest height insteps.  So thin socks it is! The boots are a  nice supple rubber, surprisingly forgiving when you walk.  There is no rubbing anywhere on me.  There are little nubs on the bottom of the foot bed...I don't hate them but am not really sure why they are necessary. If you are looking for a great, fun-ny looking boot for gardening or schlocking around in a cow pen in the spring, this might just fit the bill for you."
Crocs,Women's Jaunt Shorty Boot,B00DU93UTQ,R3SM06E91MLD58,"May 2, 2016",5,The fitted ankle area rubbed the skin off one ankle.  I wish they weren't so snug around the ankles.,"The rain boots are too fitted around the ankles to be really comfortable for me.  I would like them much better if they were straight up rather than so molded in at the heel and ankle.  I bought one size larger than normal so I could wear thick socks and so they would fit loosely.  They do slide on and off easily.  The problem is that the shape of the boots is so snugly fitted around the ankle area that when I walk, my feet move inside the boot, and  the hard thick plastic inside the ankle area rubs my ankles.  Maybe it's a problem because I bought a size too large.  Also I think my ankles turn in as I walk.  But for me, these boots rubbed the skin off one ankle after daily wearing of less than 30 minutes a day over a week even with tall socks.  I love crocs and I wear my crocs classic clogs every day.  But these rain boots hurt.  (later edit) I'm still wearing them with socks and trying to get used to them.  I think buying a size up was the mistake I made.  (later edit)  After I got used to them and my ankles toughened up a bit, I love them."

Crocs,Women's Patricia Wedge Sandal,B001IV5B7M,R2CSDSWMRW1XK3,"June 6, 2019",5,How To Make Them Fit Perfectly,"I have worn this style of Crocs sandals for several years now, and always buy another pair when one set wears out.  Once they are stretched properly for my wide-width feet, they are so comfortable to wear and I wear them practically everywhere.  Here's a tip, for those of you who buy them and are disappointed they are too narrow:  Put them on your feet and bend one foot, on your tiptoes.  Then, run a blow dryer on the side of the strap, where it meets the sole, while stretching (on your tip toes) in the shoe.  As the rubber heats up it will loosen the strap.  When you feel it give a little, stop heating it, allow it to cool down a few seconds and then check the sizing again before proceeding to heat any further.  Repeat this on the other straps until the fit is just right.  I've done this with every pair of these sandals and then they all fit perfectly afterwards.  I have never noticed any discoloration or weakening of the straps from doing this.  Good luck!"
Crocs,Women's Patricia Wedge Sandal,B001IV5B7M,R327YTPI2X5VQE,"August 27, 2016",4,Good Alternate Shoe for Plantar Fasciitis,"This is a long-ish response, and it includes commentary on several products to help with my PLANTAR FASCIITIS (some purchased on Amazon, some not). It has been about two and a half months since I started using these items. I hope this information is helpful to others! About me: 50-yr old woman; Active – city-dweller – walking 2-5 miles every day (errands, taking kids to school & etc); Former serious runner (now swimming & stationary bike); Flat-feet; Generally ~10 lbs extra. And my Plantar Fasciitis: Started about a year and a half ago (though I noticed mild & passing arch discomfort ~15 yrs ago when I was running daily); Pain is primarily in the right foot; Got much worse & persistent Spring 2016: Switched to wearing stability running shoes as often as possible + supportive summer shoes; Started seeing a foot doctor & investigating different treatments/supports June 2016. The Pain: Unlike many descriptions of plantar fasciitis, my pain was not noticeably worse first thing in the morning. It tended to be nagging during the day, and more so on days when I was walking/standing a lot. The midsole and heel area was also painful when pressed (like an internal bruise). X-rays confirmed plantar fasciitis with slight beginning of a heel spur; Dr said that plantar fasciitis can present in different ways. FUTURO ARCH SUPPORT (pharmacy & Amazon): One of the first items I purchased. Eases pain. Don’t know if it really helps, but the pressure up against the arch feels good. I tend to wear these around the house with flip-flops & sometimes without shoes. [https://www.amazon.com/Futuro-Therapeutic-Arch-Support-Moderate/dp/B00WN8LIAI/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1472218152&sr=8-1&keywords=futuro+foot+arch+support] PLANTAR FASCIITIS ARCH SLEEVE (pharmacy): Cheap, useless; Actually uncomfortable. Idea isn’t bad, but impossible to keep the gel portion exactly where it should be for maximum pressure/support. [http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/509757/450.jpg] ALPHABRACE NIGHT SPLINT (Amazon): I purchased this after reading how effective a night splint can be. And it is TRUE. After one night (~ 2hrs of wear), the sharp pain was significantly lower. It is not really comfortable to sleep in (though not intolerable either). I continue to wear the splint as often as I can – generally 5-6 days per week (day or night), for 2-3 hours each time. [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PB07S8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1] POWERSTEP ORTHOTIC (podiatrist & Amazon): My podiatrist recommended that I wear good orthotics whenever I can, so I replaced the insole in my sneakers with these. While there has been no dramatic change, I can definitely wear my running sneakers all day without real discomfort. But I don’t know if it is the orthotics – or the combination of several treatments, including the night splint. Worth noting: this orthotic was $80 from my doctor, and $33 on Amazon. [https://www.amazon.com/Powerstep-Pinnacle-Orthotics-U-Blue-Mens/dp/B000KPKMX0/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1472218880&sr=8-2&keywords=powerstep+orthotic] ORIGINAL XBRACE (Amazon): This one actually feels good. I wear it when my foot feels “fragile.” When I know I am going to be on my feet for a long time, I pop them in my bag. If my foot or arch gets sore or tired, I put them on, and I feel better right away. They are fairly comfortable with sandals & okay with sneakers. [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017MZZ7LM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1] DARCO PLANTAR FASCIITIS FOOT SLEEVE (podiatrist & Amazon): This is another one that feels good, and I use it much like I use the Xbraces – when I will be out walking a lot – or if my foot feels weak/tired. I think I prefer the Xbraces. Podiatrist charged me $35 & it is $13 on Amazon.

Probably because they make the shoe a bit tighter against the arch & they lift my heel a little. But they are half-orthotics (heel to just before the ball of the foot), so they shift a bit. [https://www.amazon.com/PROFOOT-Plantar-Fasciitis-Orthotics-Mens/dp/B007S8XYAK/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1472220517&sr=8-1&keywords=profoot+orthotic] STRETCHING: I do the usual recommended stretches for plantar fasciitis 3-4 times per week, five minutes each time. Rolling both foot over a tennis ball or rolling pin Rolling the foot over a frozen bottle of water Towel stretch – pulling the toes forward *SHOES* RUNNING SHOES: I googled “best running shoes for plantar fasciitis,” and I found several posts from good runner sites that listed stability shoes popular with runners who suffer from plantar fasciitis. Saucony seems to come up the most. DANSKO SANDALS: Though I’ve never been a huge fan of their clunky, closed clogs, their shoes come up frequently in online forums about plantar fasciitis. I’ve been fairly pleased with my katy sandals. They have a 1.25 inch heel. Worth noting, I found mine on sale for $29 (not the more common $60-99). [https://www.amazon.com/Dansko-Womens-Katy-Smooth-9-5-10/dp/B00MAVAZ6G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472219886&sr=8-1&keywords=dansko+katy] CROCS  MINI-WEDGE (Amazon): Crocs are another shoe line that comes up often in forums about plantar fasciitis. The important aspect for helping with plantar fasciitis is that the heel should be lifted and there is good support in the arch (so the loose, chunky original crocs, not so much). These mini-wedges have a 1.5 inch heel. [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IV5BAE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1] VIONIC FLIP-FLOPS (podiatrist & Amazon): Vionic shoes come up frequently in online searches about plantar Fasciitis. In addition, they seem to be the most common shoes sold in podiatrist’s offices. So I bought a pair. Price is shocking ($85!). I think they are fine; I rotate them with the crocs & the danskos. If I were to buy another pair, I would buy a model with a slightly higher heel (the heel on these is .5-.75 inch).

Crocs,Women's Patricia Wedge Sandal,B001IV5B7M,R3AALAW738NJR3,"August 19, 2016",5,Works great for me.,"I wear Crocs sandals around the house.  These are comfortable all day long.  They have great arch support and are super squishy and soft.  I've worn this type of style for many many years and they are the only shoes I wear in the house.  They are more comfy than slippers.  My entire house is tiled and this type of flooring is very hard and unless you have great support for your heels and the balls of your feet, you will definitely get an achy back and knees.  I don't get any of this because I wear this type of soft sandal.  I live in Florida so I wear this sandal year round and no other type of shoe is as comfortable as Crocs sandals.  I can't say enough good things about this style.  I found them on Amazon $15 cheaper than the mall.  These sandals don't wear out but do stretch out a bit after a few years (yes, years).  My other pair was still comfy but had stretched out in the width so it was time to order a new pair.  I would never wear anything else in the house.  They are great comfy shoes that last forever.  I definitely recommend them highly."
Crocs,Women's Patricia Wedge Sandal,B001IV5B7M,R3SQ78QUE2K7I4,"March 27, 2019",1,I do NOT Recommend!,"This is my 3rd pair of the same size and width Patricia wedge sandals.  I have plantar fasciitis and my first and second pairs were amazing quality and I could walk a lot in them, without pain, right out of the box. I bought these to replace my black pair that got sucked off my feet in the Pacific Ocean. This pair is a lot different than my first two pair.  They feel like plastic, rough and hard...whereas my others felt like smooth, soft rubber.  This pair does not have the same soft, cushiony feel.  I will note that they still gave me the support my feet need in the right place.  But... There was a spot on the inside of the left sandal that wore a blister on the inside of my foot within a couple of hours of wearing them, which did not happen with the others.  In this spot, not only did it press into my foot but there was an adhesive type of stickiness, which I think caused the sandal to stick to, and irritate that part of my foot. Update:  The blister on my foot, caused by these sandals has become an open wound on my foot.  It is very deep and sore.  I only wore them for two hours. I have read the other 1 star reviews and agree these Crocs may be knock offs, which I would be fine with.  There is no shame in my game, I'll wear knock off shoes.  But PLEASE read the other 1 star reviews and try them on carefully before you wear them, if you decide to purchase. Personally, I will never buy another pair of Crocs unless it is right from a brick and mortar store. Happy Shopping!!"

Crocs,Women's Patricia Wedge Sandal,B001IV5B7M,R2UVJ6JXZDUFFK,"September 18, 2016",5,On my FOURTH Pair! Awesome,"This is my third pair of this style of CROCS.  The first two pairs  I wore out.  What wears out?  The tread/sole, not the uppers.  The bottoms wear off and become so smooth they are like bald tires -- no traction and easy to slip.  However, this style is fantastic.  The diaganal strap makes them fit perfectly.  I can even run in these when I've had to.  Love them.The Pearl color is also awesome, and not available at the CROC stores. The color is lighter, and feels more ""nude"" than the brown shoes or other colors.  Favorite pair of shoes for five years.... UPDATE:  March 2018.  I just ordered my fourth pair. I get so many compliments, and I wear these darn near year-round. Because I've loved these, I've bought other crocs, but these are by far my favorite and look the best. Why a new pair? Over time, because I wear them so much, they get a little dingy, and the tread wears out and is too slick. But that takes a long time. I have a new pair to wear with skirts, and will use the ""old"" pair to wear just kickin' around."

I didn’t notice until I started using them and by then, it’s too late to return them. They put a button/snap right up against your foot on the inside which is incredibly uncomfortable! They feel cheap and plastic like. I had high expectations for my first Crocs. What a let down!"
Crocs,Women's Patricia Wedge Sandal,B001IV5B7M,R2JVXOKME7QG0I,"June 6, 2016",5,but I am developing bunions because of my poor shoe choice,"These are my everyday Crocs.  I was having a lot of foot pain caused by a lifetime of being either barefoot or in flip flops.  Not only have my arches fallen a bit, but I am developing  bunions because of my poor shoe choice.  Walking for any length of time was torturous.  My Mom gave me my 1st pair of Crocs sandals in the,Champaign color and I have never looked back.  My bunion growth has slowed way down and is rarely very painful.  My all over foot pain is virtually nonexistent.  I can walk all day now.  For those that think of the original sytle Crocs shoes as ugly, I'm right with you and can't bring myself to wear them, no matter the weather or activity.  But, over the last few years, they have made great strides in more mainstream styles.  I love this sandal and always have a couple of new pairs in the closet for replacements.  I guess you could say that the only real downside is if you wear them every day, like me, the uppers stretch out in a few months.  At that point, I throw them away and break out a new pair.  Also, I didn't think I would ever get to wear heels again, but I highly recommend the Leigh wedge.  They're not rubber like these, with canvas upper straps and they are so comfortable and stylish."

They have great support and otherwise are great, but having to remember to be cautious when walking more than a few steps is a little annoying."

I""m not a fan of the clog (too big) but this is just right. I've now had 4 pairs of this same style in a variety of colors. Everyone has their own style sandal but this one seems to work for everyone I recommend it to (and I've recommended it to everyone I know). I have one flat foot and one not and one pair of these works for both. It is the only shoe I could wear when I had planters fasciitis and I walked all over San Antonio in them with it. This is by far the longest review I""ve ever written but I can't say enough about how much I love these sandals!"
Crocs,Women's Patricia Wedge Sandal,B001IV5B7M,R1BZMN3QWHI28L,"January 6, 2018",3,"Sometimes too tight, but most of the time they're great","I have a love/hate relationship with these shoes. In general, they are comfortable. But, sometimes the straps feel a little tight, especially the outside strap with the croc button. I have to adjust my foot a lot when that happens and the sole under my toes doesn't fit quite right. Most of the time they fit and feel great. The sole is generally very comfy and I like the heel height. These are probably the most croc-ey Crocs I own. I wear these when I'm standing on hard tile floors for extended periods of time, and in general, my feet don't hurt after several hours. But occasionally, these are not my favorite shoe at all. It could be my feet are a bit swollen when this happens, but I don't have this problem with any of my other Crocs. Love/Hate!"
Crocs,Women's Patricia Wedge Sandal,B001IV5B7M,R9BDMGC2SRT8N,"February 23, 2015",5,so far so good!,"Received these on a Monday, after ordering Saturday, specifically for my upcoming Disney vacation. I will be sure to update my review to reflect all that walking. I typically wear a size 5-6 depending on the type of shoe. Most crocs I can wear a 4 or 5 since they run rather large, but I followed the advice of reviewers and ordered a 6. Fit perfect! The straps felt comfortable, I don't foresee the need to stretch them with a blow dryer as some have. I have pretty average foot width. I suggest this sandle for more support, weather resistance and they're pretty cute, too! UPDATE JAN 2016: I used these in Disney and they were great! I did need to slightly stretch out the right side of my right shoe because it was rubbing on my little toe. Easily done with a hair dryer. These were comfortable, offered support, and looked nice as well. I wore them over the summer as well and they've held up well and show little wear."
Crocs,Women's Patricia Wedge Sandal,B001IV5B7M,R1WDC1XOP4SF2R,"May 22, 2018",5,Comfortable slip-on sandal that provides support,"This must be my 6th pair of Crocs Patricia sandals. I have a high arch and an extremely high instep, so totally flat shoes never work well for me, but these mini-wedge Crocs have just enough height to provide the support I need without wearing a block heel. This style has become my go-to sandal for everyday use in warm weather. These sandals are easy to slip into, and yet they provide much more support than flip-flops. I also like the fact that I can scrub them in the kitchen sink if they get dirty. To me, they're not dressy enough to wear out, but for working around the house and yard and running errands, they're great. In fact, I like them so much that I bought an extra pair in white that I wear only inside the house.  I highly recommend these sandals."
Crocs,Women's Patricia Wedge Sandal,B001IV5B7M,R7OWAUD37IGKP,"July 25, 2019",3,Too narrow,"I was so sad when these sandals did not fit me. They are really lovely and so comfortable! They were just perfect to wear at home and with a dress. But I had to return because they were too narrow. I’m a size 36 and my feet are kind of wide. Still, I thought they may fit me since I have small feet but it didn’t work. Luckily seller was very nice about returning them. I did ordered another set of croc sandals after I got my refund in a different model because I like this brand very much."

My recent order of 2 more Crocs ""Patricia""  fit totally different. The size says 8, but the bands across the top of the foot are way too large. I thought they felt a little large when I first put them on (and should have returned them).  I do believe that they were stamped an 8, but were really a 9.  Now that my foot is settled into them, they are really sloppy."

They are so comfortable and I wear them everywhere with everything.  I bought the black pair to wear with dress clothes.  Women have stopped me in public to ask if they are Crocs and what style they are.  Our local shoe stores that carry Crocs don't have this particular style.  My feet are very narrow and I don't have any trouble keeping these shoes on.  I suffer from heel spurs and these shoes do not make my heels hurt, even after wearing them all day.  This is the only Croc style that I own.  I did visit a Croc store and tried on several different styles, but none were as comfortable as these!"
Crocs,Women's Patricia Wedge Sandal,B001IV5B7M,R1V29MBG5KSUG3,"August 6, 2018",3,Fit was off.,"I believe that one of these shoes was made a little smaller/tighter than the other.  I tried them on different days at one always felt tighter around the top of my foot. I have the exact same pair that I ordered directly from the crocs website and I have never had a problem with them. My other pair is rather new as well, so its not like I stretched them out or something. Also I'm not sure that these would even stretch out since they are a rubbery material. Returning them was easy, so if you are on the fence, give them a try. I like the style, but these fit weird."

I typically wear a size 10 or 10.5 in most shoes (I had bought another pair of Crocs on Amazon this same day and they were 10s and fit perfectly), so when I quickly slipped these on I thought they'd fit.  I didn't try them on again until after I had arrived in Hawaii for my vacation and the bands over my feet were really tight.  I had my sister try them on too (she typically wears a 9.5 or 10) and they were too tight for her too.  I gave them to a friend who wears an 8-8.5 and they were okay, but too long.  They don't have much stretch in them, so I don't think I could have made them work.  Really disappointed!"
Crocs,Women's Patricia Wedge Sandal,B001IV5B7M,R1V66G9OWC76BZ,"June 2, 2016",4,"Great shoe design.  Comfortable and stylish, but wish there were half sizes.","I love the material and comfort of Crocs, and the Patricia Miniwedge is a wonderful design.  The slight wedge gives me a little bit of elevation when I'm wearing long pants, but is still stable and easy to wear.  I've got this particular style in several colors now - black, grey and black, khaki and pearl, and light blue.  It's a versatile shoe that is especially great in the summer.  My only slight disappointment is that Crocs do not offer half sizes.  I would ideally be a size 8.5.  The size 8 fits a bit too tightly across the top of my foot (the very back strap especially).  Unfortunately, the size 9 is too big all around.  I have settled for the size 8, which usually loosens up just enough after a few months of wearing."
Crocs,Women's Meleen Cross Band Slide Sandal,B07DLRDXMD,R9FBCQ00CVGMW,"April 26, 2019",1,What Happened to the Meleen Crocs Back (Heel) Strap?? Huge Disappointment!,"I buy a pair of these each year because they are incredibility comfortable, cool and waterproof. But, what the heck happened to this year's (2019) Meleens? The back or heel strap is so short it forces your toes out the front of the sandal with a hang-over of 1.5"" to 2"". Can you imagine how it looks for your toes to be hanging over the front of the sandal? The right shoe's straps across my foot are longer than the straps on the left sandal. So much so that my foot slips, slides and twists leaving it impossible to walk in without the risk of breaking my neck. Also, the right sandal is longer than the left. I have to question whether these are the real deal. The glue is very visible on the right sandal in multiple places where it appears it oozed out to a degree of being visible with a glance."

However, wearing it that way pushes her foot forward, with her toes over the edge of the shoe and its very uncomfortable to walk in.  The strap can be flipped forward to go across the foot instead - but none of the pictures show this, so you may not be expecting that when you purchase it."

These are not regular size, they are relaxed fit per the tag and Wide per the embossed stamp on the bottom.  They DO NOT run small.  They in fact run huge.  The shoe does not fit at all in any size and the back strap is not a back strap but a over the instep strap that is huge.  The pivoting strap cannot be worn over or behind the foot."

Not the same old comfortable Crocs anymore.,"I own 20+ pairs of crocs of all styles and designs and not one has ever been uncomfortable until this pair.  The first time I wore them (for a short time, no less) they rubbed a horrible blister on the inside of both feet before I knew what was happening.  It’s been two weeks and this blister is so bad it still hasn’t healed.  This has NEVER happened with any other pair of Crocs including two other pairs of Meleens.  I’m scared to ever dare wear these again so this was a total waste of money."
Crocs,Women's Meleen Cross Band Slide Sandal,B07DLRDXMD,R24QEUR1EW8M8U,"June 9, 2019",4,Great replacement for flip flops!!,"I was just diagnosed with plantar fasciitis a couple of weeks ago and my doctor recommended the classic clog style of Crocs for my upcoming beach vacation as a flip flop replacement.  I absolutely HATE the look of the classic clog Crocs so I browsed around for other Crocs styles hoping one would work for my feet.  I ordered a couple of styles from Amazon and this is THE ONE that worked for my feet.  I just wore these for a week on vacation almost all day long every day and this is the first time in months I have been foot pain free.  I could even wear them in the very shallow kiddie pool to prevent my feet from getting sore.  Beach sand rinses right off as well.  I ordered a second pair to wear around my house.  The one thing that keeps this shoe from being a 5 star rating is the heel strap.  It's not long enough to go around your heel.  It can only be used flipped on top of your foot, which rubbed some here and there when wet.  I wear a shoe size 10 and I went with the size 10 in these as well.  They have a slightly loose fit so I was a little concerned my feet would still hurt, but they worked great."

The seller should indicate which shoes are better for those who ware 1/2 sizes.  Also, the strap has the option to go across the top of the foot or the around the back of the heel. I did not get to try the back because of being too small, and the strap over the foot was always a struggle, maybe because they are too tight."
Crocs,Women's Meleen Cross Band Slide Sandal,B07DLRDXMD,R7JRBC58L9B6Y,"September 20, 2019",3,Comfortable not attractive,"I only started buying Crocs after I had kids. Toddler Crocs are freaking adorable, no two ways about that. Then I ventured out of classic Crocs and bought toddler Crocs sandals. Again, amazing! The kiddos loved every pair. Then I learned that Crocs make shoes for grown up that are not the typical ugly Crocs. From the photos, they could pass off as regular shoes. Great! I ordered these, the Cleo style as well as Kaydee flip flops. This style and Cleo are not attractive and they don't look like regular sandals. They still look clunky. I saw a mom at the playground with the Kelli style of Crocs and it didn't look good on her either. The Kaydee flip flops are good but run very small. I guess if you like Birkenstocks and Teva sandals you might be okay with this look."

I love how comfortable they are and, that they fit my narrow foot.  I saw that the design was a tiny bit different but as the footbed looked the same,  I decided to give them a go.  BAD MOVE.  What the description does NOT say, but the label on the shoe does is that these are a relaxed fit.  And that top strap that is now movable?  Does nothing.  Doesn't go back over your heel and just floats over the top of your foot, not doing anything and looking ill fitting.  These are probably the poorest designed crocs I have ever seen - and I've seen a lot.  Sad to say, they are going back today.  Do not buy these shoes."
Crocs,Women's Meleen Cross Band Slide Sandal,B07DLRDXMD,R37CB2NCOZ2PSZ,"April 28, 2019",5,Just what I needed,"These are very comfy (I have plantar fasciitis).  I also have wide feet and these fit nicely: not as roomy as the regular Crocs clogs, but still plenty of room without being tight or too loose and slipping off. I will probably order more of these in a different color or a similar style of Crocs since they have a good amount of cushioning in the heel."

Right out of the bag, this pair was like walking on clouds with no break-in period. The material has a bouncy give that feels wonderful on the feet and absorbs shock under the heel. The metallic details elevate the shoes above the usual Croc casual look. However, I ordered both colors and liked the black version much, much better. The white one looks very plastic-ky and cheap in real life. The black version look much nicer and can easily be dressed up or down. I normally wear 6.5 in shoes and purchased size 6 in this style.

Some of the Crocs have fit a little snug on me, especially that Patricia style.  I will throw mine in the dryer For about five minutes to get them warm and then I put them on my feet and they stretch to fit perfectly as they cool. This pair is also tight especially across my instep and I have a slightly high instep.  They were so uncomfortable that I decided to take a risk with the dryer trick.  I wasn’t sure about that metallic thing but they’re unwearable otherwise.  I tried it once and sure enough they got soft and felt wonderful. But it seemed that they shrink back. I tried it again with the same result. I’m going to try it one more time and leave them in the dryer longer, maybe eight minutes.  I’ll wrap my foot with a bandage and then put them on."

They are very comfortable! Kinda like a nice snuggly hug for my feet! I do feel like they are a little long for my feet, however that could just be how proper fitting shoes are supposed to be? Not sure haha. I did have bunion surgery on my right foot (I think you can see the scar in the first pic) and I like how that part of my foot has a little window to bulge out of instead of the shoe pressing against it. Def a plus for me. I normally wear a 6-1/2 altho I should wear wide shoes. I bought this in 6W and fits very nicely. I can see how the white does look very “rubbery/cheap” in person up close  BUT from looking down at them on my feet I think they look really pretty and classy and they feel incredibly durable. Haven’t worn them for a long time so I hope they stay comfortable. If so, I’ll def be buying in the black ones as well!"

I decided to reorder to a size 7 which are a little too long but they didn't hurt my toes.  I love the look of them and they do soften up with use - they get more of a bounce when walking.

It fits true to size, I am size 7 and ordered the same and fits me well. It is a great sandal for evening wear but not for beach especially if you plan to do lot of walking. It is not the sandal itself but the style and personal preference. This style is not convenient."

They feel very soft inside and are most comfortable. Looking forward to the summer season when they will be my go to for most occasions.  Will probably get another pair in black. This is my first pair of Crocs and I'm glad I gave them a try. I have a somewhat narrow foot (except for a bunion) and this cutout in this sandal handles it comfortably.

The wedge is the same as a patricia, but the top of the sandal is different and fits me even better.  It's also very pretty and can be worn dressy or casual.  I ordered the white ones and they fit so well and are so pretty that I've now just ordered the black ones."

I was looking for a little accent or maybe a bit of bling but these were a bit clunky and boring. I love the hammered metal detail on some of the other Sanrah styles. I wish Crocs would find more ways to add a little sparkle.

Crocs,Men's and Women's Athens Flip Flop,B01N4GC3BH,RCBW55F8NAW54,"December 13, 2017",1,What happened? This sandal is now made smaller than before?!,"I am on my third pair. I love this sandal. I live in this sandal. HOWEVER........ I have purchased these before in M4/W6 off Amazon so I hit reorder for the same size I always get as they're perfect for me. (I wear a Women's 8 so that should tell you how weird the sizes are for this sandal). I get them today and they are too small! They indeed indicate M4/W6 but they have been made too small. Also, they are less wide. My other pairs have been 3 1/2"" at its widest point and the new ones are only 3 1/4"" so my foot hangs over the sides. Now I have to send them back and reorder again. Do I try for the same size thinking maybe this pair I got today were some defect or do I order a size up? I guess I'll try a size up and see what happens. I'm bummed. EDIT 12/19/17 : I ordered a size up and STILL TOO SMALL. I'm going to have to return these also. I can't believe it. I'm going to give up now. They've changed the sizing of this sandal obviously. If you have a wider foot, this sandal may not be an option anymore. Now I want to cry...this was my favorite. I lived in these! :("
Crocs,Men's and Women's Athens Flip Flop,B01N4GC3BH,R11S0HAPSLT9KM,"June 18, 2018",2,Avoid these if you plan on getting your feet wet.,"Do not wear these when they are wet. They are extremely slippery against your feet and will slide out from under your foot. In dry conditions they are fine, they have good cushion, good ground traction and work well.  Get them wet and they are positively dangerous to walk in. I cannot reccomend them at all due to this. I had a pair of these in the past that were fantastic under all conditions, evidently Crocs have changed the design and possibly the construction materials."

I thought Crocs had discontinued making them, and maybe they did for a time, but they're now available as a unisex style.  Maybe that's why I thought they weren't available. These are THE MOST COMFORTABLE shoes I've ever worn.  I've even worn them hiking.  They're my beach shoes, pool shoes, my everything shoes.  I can't sing their praises enough.  I will say, though, that the sizing has changed.  My old ones are a 6/8, and I ordered 7/9 and they fit perfectly.  The new 7/9 may be slightly longer than the old 6/8.  I normally wear a 9W or 9 1/2M in a regular shoe.  I ordered according to the size chart, so you can feel confident ordering according to the chart.  I just ordered one pair, but now I'm getting the other 3 colors and will eventually buy duplicates to put away for future in case Crocs discontinues them again.  PLEASE DON'T!!!!  Also, MORE COLORS PLEASE!!!!!!!"

They have a hard plastic feel to them and are not comfy like they used to be. Crocs always had a soft fubber feel. They have been changed and made cheaper they are also smaller and not as wide as they used to be. I am not happy and will not order anymore until they make them how they used to be.

However I had an odd incident with the flips .I am in southeast Texas and it has been wicked hot here . I forgot them outside by the pool for 2 days .When I tracked them down and slipped them on they shrunk !!! All kidding aside my rubber flip flops shrunk . The flops were handed down to my mom . We haven't been able to share shoes since I was 12 . Don't leave them in the South Texas Sun for a day or two And they should work well ."
Crocs,Men's and Women's Athens Flip Flop,B01N4GC3BH,RX8AKVW03HNC5,"February 21, 2018",5,Better than the new style,"Even though these are the old style Crocs they are better than the newer style as the toe thong is built as a part of the slipper. The new style has the toe protrusion through the base of the slipper and like every other rubber slipper can be a failure point. Bought this for my mother as she uses them as house slippers. Her old ones are still going strong, but figured she should get new ones before they stop making these."
Crocs,Men's and Women's Athens Flip Flop,B01N4GC3BH,R3G1ZGN277ICAO,"June 21, 2019",4,Comfortable. Seems durable. Lightweight.,"Lots of cushiony support. I have a perma-callus on the ball of my foot and I am most comfortable in these and my regular crocs. Small bumps on footbed massage without causing discomfort. There is a raised ridge under the toe knuckles that actually helps a lot with foot grip. Thong that goes between toes is soft and flexible. I like that the frame is molded as one piece, the lighter colored footbed is a second piece, but many times the thong attaches through the sole, this is not the case here. Underside is classic Crocs sole, not slippery on either side. Despite their size they are very, very light. I do think that they are about a half size too big, so they may run a bit large, but I am happy with them. I wear a size 13M, so they are going to look like skis on me anyway. Based on previous brand experience, I believe these to be potentially very long-lasting. One star off, because they are a little big, which means they aren’t perfect, but close. Not a whole star off, maybe 1/3"
Crocs,Men's and Women's Athens Flip Flop,B01N4GC3BH,R1KDS68PYB4TYT,"May 29, 2018",2,Webbing between toes is very uncomfortable,"I had high hopes for these lightweight flip flops.  They were purchased for a trip to Hawaii and since they're so light thought they'd be perfect to save suitcase weight.  However, I should have worn them longer before the trip.  After walking in them for about 15 minutes I started developing blisters between the 1st and 2nd toes where the webbing attaches to the footbed.  The problem is the plastic webbing is too wide for some.  Since I'd already walked in them and scuffed them up I didn't think they could be returned so ended up giving them away and wore my cheap backup pair of flip flops the remainder of the trip."

Well, ok. So I order the 9. Still slightly larger. Interesting. Moderately comfortable, not the best out there. Not ideal for extended use. The piece between your toes is abnormally large, hope you have a sizeable toe gap. Lol. These get SLICK when wet. Saw this in another review and thought ""really? But ok"" and yes. Very slick. NOT good for anything with water. What I DO like is that the entire sole of the shoe is a single injection mold (the black pieces) that includes the top and the piece between your toes, with a separate piece inside that (the light gray) HOPEFULLY that stupid thing between my toes doesn't break. They always break on my sandles."
Crocs,Men's and Women's Athens Flip Flop,B01N4GC3BH,R2ULFUJBVLBR87,"February 19, 2019",2,Cheap,"I've owned these exact same crocs for 8 years.  I purchased them from my college campus bookstore.  Loved them so much that when they finally broke, I searched the internet until I found the exact same pair and size.  The only difference is the color and missing my school logo. WTF!?! Man, this is some cheap Chinese knock-off and off and off.  You feel that the plastic is a cheaper plastic.  What's worse is they are actually made smaller.  They put the same size on it but made it smaller!  I know because my toe hits the rise at the edge.  This is why I don't shop Walmart. I kept it because I needed a shoe for right now but its still worries me."
Crocs,Men's and Women's Athens Flip Flop,B01N4GC3BH,RKHD2LLGD74GG,"September 13, 2019",2,"NOT what I was expecting. They have changed, not for the better","I've owned a pair of these for years, but they are well worn. They get used in the yard, sometimes fairly hard .. but they have held up well. The old ones have very good support, not too squishy and they fit well. They are size 10. I wanted another pair, so I ordered another size 10.  Though the length is the same, nothing else is. The tongue attachment is further forward, so they fit odd. The straps are WAY TOO WIDE. I need extra wide shoes, but these make my feet appear thin.  The heal area is crazy unstable .. more like walking on an unstable gel pillow. I'm REALLY not pleased with these. Not sure it's worth sending back, but I won't keep them. Might give them to the Salvation Army. I do NOT recommend these flip flops."

I've broken the bones on top of both feet, so I can't wear anything that puts pressure on them. These are perfect for me! I wear them year round here in the south except on rainy days when wear my Mary Jane Crocs. Crocs are the only shoes I wear. These are also a pretty shade of blue. I normally wear my black Crocs, but these will look better with denim."

These fit and all that, but they don't have the wonderful cushion to the sole, cheap seams on the edge near the toe portion and are overall disappointing. I used to pay $30 for a pair of these. I paid a third less than that and all I can say is they priced them according to quality now. Sad to see such a great summer staple going away."

Still kind of tight for avg weight guy.,"This my 4th pair of Athens.  Each pair lasted for 3-4 years with year round use living in Tampa Bay beaches.  I'm a fan of this go anywhere wet/dry flip flop obviously. I'm a shoe size 10 normally with sneakers, work shoes.  My first pair of Athens were size 10, second-third pair size 11 exact same size as this pair.  Granted my current pair are stretched some put these are still pretty snug just on top where your toes slip in. Could be a combination of the width/top of sandal height. So much so I'll can wear for only a couple hours at a time while they stretch out.  My weight has not  increased and I don't think my feet are swollen, etc. lol  I'm keep them and will break them in.  No other flip flop I know of will last for years, go from sand, dirt, pavement, lake/oceans, with no care but a hose.  Writing review to let wearers know to go up one size and if you have one use a ""shoe stretcher"" when not wearing them to speed up break-in period."
Crocs,Men's and Women's Athens Flip Flop,B01N4GC3BH,R2P2R1AU1S8T7R,"February 2, 2020",4,"Comfort and value, I got mine! 8)","I've had these prior and they've last a few years, comfortably.  The only thing is to get  a right fit you have to consider the inside foot pad fit then the containing thong in which the foot pad fits.  I tried an 11 prior but the 12 fit better for me.  The latter is a quarter-inch or so wider around if you want your foot to fit the comfort curves of the foot pad contained.  The comfort curves of the insert foot pad didnt fit me as well as it does with the size 12.  It requires getting used to the edges potentially catching where other designs don't have that issue.  For me, it got this as the material color is a light blue color that doesn't color carpeting as the usual black rubber color of popular thongs tend.  Unlike many people I don't always lift my foot high enough when walking so my slipper toe catches on this forcing me to relearn and I have so it's but I mention it as it may cause some to fall.  It is NOT a design flaw, but if you were in a store you'd find out quickly whether it'd work for you or not.  The slipper is easy to get on and off, and a little cushier than most thong style rubber slippers and I've become accustomed to living with them daily inside home as opposed to outside.  I'd recommend these to those who could get safely beyond the caveats I mentioned.  I like my pair.  Also, I do not walk on wet surfaces so cannot speak to that issue as other reviews have mentioned.  Thank you."

I held the old ones and new one's heel to heel and the new ones, same size, are over an inch shorter!  Same size and I can't wear them, my heel hangs over the back. Luckily my wife can wear them so we don't have to return. Honestly, size 7 from Crocs should be size 7. Not size 6 or size 5 1/2. Really? Talk about stupid and cheap of Crocs."

So, I switched to the Athens, which fit my wide foot well. They take a beating: I walk miles of concrete daily, and the Croslite material wears very well. Alas, I finally had to retire that pair, and as usual, the new pair is smaller and narrower. The Athens crocs from several years ago fit much better than the Athens of 2017. Now I'm searching for a new brand."
Crocs,Men's and Women's Athens Flip Flop,B01N4GC3BH,R16VS088PQPJNR,"May 28, 2018",2,Unsafe,"In my opinion, these flip flops are not safe.  The heel soles are too rounded, making it easy to roll one's ankle.  They also do not sit properly on my feet.  They want to be at an angle, and it's difficult to keep them on properly.  It may be because the size I ordered is one size smaller than I usually order, but even then they seem a bit too large.  The Unisex Modi flip flops (which Crocs has decided not to make any more) are MUCH better in all respects (except perhaps in the strength of the front strap attachment.  I have been wearing various types of flip flops for over 60 years, and the Modis were the best (though as with all Crocs products ridiculously over priced).  The Athens flip flops are unacceptable to me."

I've changed from my three-star rating here - Maybe they'll be better after broken in.  I thought they would be softer but they are initially a bit stiff and uncomfortable.  I'll plead guilty about thinking they would feel more like non-flip-flop Crocs.  Still, they are well-made and will hopefully become more comfortable with normal wear -  to a five star.  Be patient, after a few days the Crocs conform to your feet and are very comfortable.."

They still stayed in place but now let water in. These have one solid sole but the fit is totally different for the same size and I have to put effort in there to keep them on my feet. It's not the size, it's just the design that's totally off."

Comparing that pair to this pair by holding them together by the soles, this pair is nearly an inch shorter in length than my original pair! My heels hang off the backs and touch the ground. Huh?

In fact, he got up and Purposefully walked around in them because of the ""cushioning"" support in them . He even got a little choked up saying he never gets support and things hurt his feet as he walks because the 'flip flops' he wears are so thin and (he is so heavy) debris like little rocks, pebbles, even sticks will poke through the thin soles and hurt his feet . Not only that, he is afraid any injury might not heal correctly.. but these gav great Support, and were definitely ""Sturdy"".

I recently bought a pink pair and it is the cutest pink color, so watched the prices, and bought another pair just like them when the price dropped!

These seemed similar but when I got them they did not have any support or cushion like my old pair, the middle of toe part gets irritating you can't wear all day. And I have back issues that have arised significantly since I started wearing these. I kept them to be shower shoes when I work out and my laundry shoes because of the price it wasn't worth the hassle to return. The quality of the brand seemed to go down. Idk if I'm gonna try buying another different pair, as this is the 4th I've purchased of the brand and sizing was wrong on one, these are cheap quality and actually generic flip flops I found from discount store have given me better support and more comfy. Or just stick with my super old, but durable, comfortable, and like new minus the white is dirty after 13 odd years, hot pink ones that match nothing in my closet lol... as I'm not sure why none of these are working out. I did 3 stars as they came as pictured, guess for the brand and price they are ok? And maybe I just need to be more picky about my shoes as they might be a great fit for someone else. Just not me."
Crocs,Crocband Flip Flop,B07CN7JHH5,R31HRT54AWE666,"July 26, 2019",4,Would recommend if you want a firm structured pair of flip flops.,I got these to use them around my apartment as we have tile and my feet get really fatigued. They are not very cushy so I’m a little disappointed as I was looking for some relief from walking on hard floors but I traded it for hard flip flops. I have wide feet and these still have a bit of a gap between my feet and the strap which I don’t mind but may be a problem for people with regular or narrow feet. I’m sure this is due to them being unisex so it should be expected. The texture on the sole is not bothersome and it does have some arch support which can be good or bad depending on the person. These seem like they will hold up nicely.  I haven’t had to clean them yet but this material seems like it will be an easy task. The color was true to what was online and shipping was prompt.

They were also just fine for wearing out to casual cafes, bars, restaurants, etc. I like the textured surface - felt good on my feet and helped my feet grip when damp. They were so light-weight and comfortable, I ended up wearing them to go on long walks along the beach and through the town of San Pedro instead of sandals, because my sandals made my feet feel heavy and hot in comparison! I didn't get any close-ups of the flip flops, but these photos give an idea."
Crocs,Crocband Flip Flop,B07CN7JHH5,R1Z2GKHWRJB8MS,"September 24, 2019",5,Another trusty pair of flip flops,As usual these flip flops are perfect. I have ordered these from amazon before..always fits the same and everything - I saw some reviews where people said there was a funky size difference...but u have to make sure u are paying attention to getting the US size for your gender. I wear a 9 in women’s sneakers but I always get these crocs in 6m/8w size. This pair will be my new house flip flops since I lost one of my previous ones.  I’m sure I will order another pair next summer for outside wear. Sidebar: make sure u don’t leave them in a super hot area. I had mine in the car all day in the sun in the middle of summer- it was wedged between a bucket and a beach ball and the croc totally warped onto the ball and it was irreversible!

I love these style of flip flops bc they are really comfortable and wide enough for my feet. I was looking to replace my black pair I've currently been wearing for several yrs. When they arrived they are much smaller then my current pair. Or any of my other pair. I have this style in black, navy, and white. They are all the same except the pair I just ordered. I'm not sure why it's so much smaller but I'll have to return."

I thought it was tacky and silly for me. Years later, it's been the most comfortable flip flop or even shoe I've ever tried. As a former USPS letter carrier, it's hard to find a shoe or footwear that is comfortable enough to wear for long period. These feel great. It's like it absorbs all the shock.  But be careful when wet!  Super slippery  Glad I found them on Amazon for great price. I have extra wide feet and it fits just right.  I'm thinking for people with normal to narrow feet, these will definitely be wide for you.  But flip flops are supposed to be a tiny bit oversized. Perfect fit for me."

This pair is way harder than my old pair. I have maybe ten pairs of different kinds of Crocs shoes so far and the newer ones all tend to become harder and harder. I figured the company is just no longer making the soft ones anymore. I still like this pair but no as much as the older versions. They are still good to wear but aren't as soft and comfortable as my old ones.

My 1st pair i purchased directly from their home website. And they were way more expensive! But when i recieved them and put them on and started walking around in them i couldn’t believe how comfortable they were, and how quiet! I’ve always been a huge fan of Reefs,and i still am (i own 14 pairs,and Reefs aren’t cheap!). I STILL love my Reefs but THESE are incredibly comfortable....and they’re all rubber! But not not just ordinary rubber...it’s called Crosslite,and it’s their proprietary material which they use on all of their footwear. It’s incredibly comfortable,takes forever to wear down and very “bouncy”. And great arch support. I own 11 pairs of their men’s footwear because they’re very stylish,they look great and super comfortable. And they are definitely worth the price (they usually have 30-50% off sales). I highly recommend these Crocs flips, especially at this price (because it won’t last)"
Crocs,Crocband Flip Flop,B07CN7JHH5,R31QSSRHHV07TD,"October 26, 2019",3,White pair is one size too big,I normally wear a men’s 11 wide. Ordered the white pair in mens11  but they are one size too big. So you could definitely get a smaller size at least in the white ones. Also if you have a wide foot the straps will dig into your foot and hurt because the straps are on the inside of the sandal instead of the outside. They’re not as comfy as I expected.  I got them to wear after my wedding during the reception so I would be comfortable. They didn’t really do the job  I ended up going barefoot. I can still wear them if needed just not for that long.

We live in Guam, so flipflops are worn daily as a necessity. Out of all my flipflops, these are my daily ""go to"" and are the ones by the front door. I finally blew one of the black ones out working in the backyard, but these have been so used, so durable and the traction on the bottom keeps slipping from occurring. They are VERY comfortable and they even float! Had to buy another black pair to replace the ones that finally met their untimely end. EXCELLENT product!"

I typically wear flip-flops that are made from a yoga mat type material. If you get them wet, they squish and foam and squeak and eventually start to stink up a storm. Not these bad boys! They dry off quickly, offer much more in the way of arch support, and are wide enough for my fat foot. Ordered them in both grey and black - did NOT have any size discrepancy issues like some other reviewers did. I'll definitely be broadening my collection of colors. These are the real deal!"

I was looking for a more professional look, and a more durable sole, and tried these Mercy Work Mules. But they are being returned today. Even though the Mercy Work Mules are shown as having ""Roomy"" fit, meaning they should be as wide as original Crocs (which are also ""Roomy"" fit), these Mercy shoes are not nearly as wide as the original Crocs. My little toes were squeezed pretty badly, it was uncomfortable just wearing them around the house. I can't imagine being on my feet for hours in these. The shoe is attractive and well-made. For those who normally wear a D width up to a E width, they would probably fit well. I normally wear a womens' 7, and the size 7 was the correct length for me. Just wasn't wide enough."
Crocs,Women's Mercy Work Clog,B003ZJINVQ,R2U0O66AJA3N42,"February 17, 2018",5,Great for all day wear!,"I have narrow feet and this specifically-women's-fitted croc is perfect. I am a size 8 in shoes but 7.5 in heels because of my narrow feet. The size 8 fit perfectly with a tad bit of room for my toes and socks. The nobbed footbeds prevent slipping so that extra bit of room is great. If I wear thicker socks the crocs fit fairly snug which is fine for around the house but might get stuffy in all-day wear. There are no vents so feet can get a little toasty with socks. The arch support is fantastic and the bottom, non-slip tread is great!! Both features are much better than my Specialst vented clogs I wear for work. Both are very easy to clean. The only con is vents on the sides to let the feet breathe, otherwise this croc is perfect."
Crocs,Women's Mercy Work Clog,B003ZJINVQ,R1OMWQLJMWY2I6,"October 16, 2016",5,Great Work Shoes!,"I love these shoes! I work in the medical field and I am on my feet all day, though these shoes are so comfortable I hardly have the usual ""foot fatigue"" at the end of a shift. They are a little wide but that's just how Crocs shoes are made to fit. The heel strap does a good job keeping your feet in place when you walk, however it's a good idea to wear socks high enough to cover your heel - I always do but I can imagine this can cause blistering if you wear ankle socks. I originally owned Crocs' Neria work clog, however they did not have the croslite insole (which these have) and were quite heavy compared to these (which are as light as a pair of flip flops). Easy to clean and spill proof. Very stylish. I strongly recommend these and will definitely buy another pair when these wear out."

Also, the right one leans and wont stay on my foot without clenching my toes for each step. It's not my foot, all my other shoes are just fine.  At 25.00 for crocs, they should be a lot better. Probably going to return them. I really wanted them too. I'm a home health care aide and take my shoes off in the clients home so I wanted something that I could slip on and off easily. UPDATE: I returned them and ordered the next size up. My refund? 5 CENTS. I'm furious."
Crocs,Women's Mercy Work Clog,B003ZJINVQ,R1X6Q94OFHO4S,"January 18, 2019",4,Nice shoe,"I liked the comfortable fit, and the material (rubber?).  These are not as roomy as other Crocs I have owned and I am not sure why—maybe my last ones were both men/women and these are specific to women.  I have very wide, flat feet with bunyans (they don’t hurt—they are just there).  I think my feet are also thick from the top to bottom because a lot of shoes feel like the top is too firm on the top of my foot.  I am 5’4” and am 150lbs, slightly athletic.  My foot measured about 9.5 inches and the size chart said up to 9.63” in foot length, which I think would be fine if your foot was normal or thinner.  Love them but wish I just had beautiful long feet, lol.  (My tribe did not even have a word for shoe because we never wore them in maybe my great grandma’s lifetime)"
Crocs,Women's Mercy Work Clog,B003ZJINVQ,R203MKWW3CRUB4,"February 16, 2018",5,great work shoes,i wear these  mercy croc clogs everyday for work.i also wear them when i am not at work because they are the most comfortable shoes ever for me..they fit as expected. sometimes they get a little hot after many hours because no holes for ventilation as seen  in other  styles but  i just kick them off a bit while i am on my break or lunch if i need to... its  a small price to pay for comfortable shoes to wear all day that my work wont complain about.they do not allow crocs  with holes . also this style seems to hold up better than my other  style crocs did...the others i use to have to replace every year because the bottoms would be completely worn down and slippery... but i have a pair  of the mercy clogs i have  been wearing going on 3 years now with everyday use and  still bottoms are not worn down...i bought this  backup pair last year to have on hand just incase. sometimes i just cant find them getting ready for work in the mornings.so with 2 pair the odds will be pretty low that i will be late due to lost shoes..will continue to buy more as needed in the future.
Crocs,Women's Mercy Work Clog,B003ZJINVQ,R36BTQYKOS069Q,"August 3, 2018",1,They run skinny. Good luck.,"Vietnamese interpretation of what ""wide"" should be. My Dutch feet can't really wear them. My foot at the widest part measures 3.5 inches, the shoe on the outside widest part measures 3.5. So pretty uncomfortable to wear, instep was more than adequate, maybe too much since I consider myself to have a high instep. Perhaps some measurements might have done me good. Totally satisfied by delivery, though."
Crocs,Women's Mercy Work Clog,B003ZJINVQ,RPOJR2RL4RFWT,"August 21, 2011",4,"Better design, not quite as comfortable as the classic","Sizing: I know there has been a lot of confusion over the sizing of this particular shoe, and for good reason. The Crocs website only recommends ordering a half size down if you wear a half size (since they only offer whole sizes in this style). However, this shoe definitely runs big. I ordered a size 8, even though I usually wear a size 9. (I was wearing a size 8 Men's in the Bistro Croc). They almost seemed too big when I got them, but after a couple of days they adjusted to my feet and I didn't have to wear the heel strap anymore. This shoe is also a lot narrower than others, which partly contributes to the sizing difference. I would suggest choosing another style if you have wide feet. Design: These shoes are definitely designed a lot better than the older styles. They still offer the non-slip soles and the same type of nubby interior material. They look a lot better (a little less like clown shoes) than previous versions. Also, the soles come up higher on the shoe and seem to be a bit stronger (good news for me because the last pair were done in by a small hole in the toe). Like most Crocs designed for work, they are enclosed so they are spill-proof and easy to clean. These are not your typical flat Crocs though, you can see they have a raised arch. Fit/Comfort: Upon first trying these on, I found they definitely don't fit like the Bistro or more classic styles that were wide and roomy. As said before, they are narrower and more conforming to the foot, and have taken me a little while to get used to. I wore them during 10 hour shifts three days in a row, and I did have blisters on my little toes by the third day. With only a day's break however, I have been able to go back to wearing them without this problem. My feet were also kind of sore the first few days, but this happens with most new shoes. Because of the new design, you really have to break these in, and they will conform to your feet to cause less pain and rubbing (although a lot of the older styles didn't really have a break-in period). Overall, if you are looking to combine a more desirable look with comfort, these are great shoes to buy. If you really don't care about the look, however, I might suggest one of the more classic Crocs styles, as they may be just a little bit more comfortable."

I'm normally a size 7 1/2 and purchased an 8. First mistake. This is my 3rd pair of crocs. I'm an Operating Room nurse and crocs are the only brand I believe in. I started with the original when they first hit the market and then had a pair of bistro and my next pair is this shoe. This shoe is not as comfortable as the other two but I do highly recommend them. Can never go wrong with crocs.

They still look and feel like new and as I said, I seriously get compliments on them at least once per week! They are so comfortable and cute! I was a little skeptical because I had read reviews that the design pattern peeled off but mine shows no signs of wear at all. I wanted to take pictures but if I wait until I can take a good picture then I probably won't post my review so just wanted to say that these are probably the best shoes I've ever owned. My only complaint if you can even call it that because I had free returns is that they run very large. I am normally a size nine to nine and a half and I had to get an 8 but they fit perfectly!"

Also you absolutely cannot wear these without socks unless you want to sound like your feet are farting with every step. The whole reason I bought this is because I recently became disabled from an illness and wanted a shoe I could put on without help that didn't require socks for the few times I needed to leave the house. I'm going to try the original croc to see if that avoids the vacuum affect. I will keep these in case I ever feel better because they might be cute with a pair of black socks or something."

They were comfortable and beat the $75 nursing clogs I got that felt like I was walking on cement bricks all day. Then the squeaking started from the plastic “hinges” where the heel strap attaches, so I stopped putting it behind my heel and instead in the front. Now the oval treads on the bottom are flopping around because they have unstuck from the shoe. Very disappointed- considering I wear these for 5-6 hours, 4 days a week. It’s been 4 months of use."
Crocs,Women's Mercy Work Clog,B003ZJINVQ,R15P9SHNUPF4XH,"April 4, 2019",2,Poor Quality,The biggest issue I had with these is that the under sole began to peel up on the left shoe almost immediately after I bought them. Also they are NOT comfortable without socks. They actually rubbed a blister on the top of my foot near my arch when I tried to wear them without socks. They're almost sharp on that top part and cut into the skin. However I hate returning things and they were comfortable cushion and arch support wise so I stubbornly continued to wear them even as the sole continued to peel off of the bottom until I finally got fed up and threw them away. Disappointing. They were cute at least. I wish they'd been made better.

Based on their chart information it said I should order an 8.  I was worried because the drop down list said 8M, 7M, 6M etc. Typically for Crocs, that means  8 MEN'S, 7 MEN'S, 6 MEN'S etc. and then women go down 2 sizes  BUT it said  women's sizing.  So I ordered my women's size 8. THEY ARE GIGANTIC.  I should have ordered my Croc size of a 6M which is a 8 in Men's! Anyway, I am Sending them back.

They are a bit heavier compared to regular Crocs, but they're Croc work clogs!! The only thing I would change is to make the heel 1/2 inch instead of 1 inch, but after wearing them for a day and a half, my feet are not complaining at all. I liked wearing them when I am cooking, as I am a spill-prone chef, and the slip resistant bottom is helpful, although I won't take it for granted that I can walk over spilled soup or anything remotely oily without care."

These are really nice shoes. They're cute, professional, and easy to wear all day. The non-slip bottoms work well, and they're comfy. The problem is they don't come in half sizes, so depending on your foot, you may need to research best fit first. Usually I order a women's 9 in Crocs cause I have a wide foot, so they fit more comfortably. These, unlike their other flats, are made bigger. So the toes have plenty of room and fit amazingly. However, since I'm really an 8.5, there's about a half inch too much space at the heel. It's fixable, as Crocs can be shrunk in heat (when done carefully!!), so I won't complain about that. If you have tiny feet though, and you're a half size, you may want to order them smaller, since they are made wider and larger than most women's Crocs. I do really like them though!"

She was shook that my crocs didn't look like those regular ugly crocs haha and think these are really cute because they look like regular plain black flats!! I'll be buying a second pair for her! Crocs. More comfy that my old restaurant shoes. I got these because they're not the typical weird looking crocs but they have the comfort of regular crocs. I wish I just sized up though instead of sizing down (I have wide feet and I'm a half size at 6.5) So I got the 6 instead of the 7. I could have fit the 7, I think. With the 6, my toes are touching the tip for sure, but I have wide feet so I know that these fit wide feet. I'll keep the 6 though because it doesn't move around when I'm walking and it stays put and I feel like I have a smaller chance of rolling my ankle on them. BEWARE THOUGH! I did get blisters when I didn't wear no show socks/regular socks. Blisters on the back of my heel on one foot an both feet on the inside of my arches I got blisters. My trick though is to put vaseline or candle wax(when it's still liquid) and put it along the line where you blister. It's an old trick I learned from my chinese grandma. It works 90% of the time.

And I only plan on wearing these during the summer, not sure what I'm going to do when it's colder again."
Crocs,Women’s Crocs At Work Flat,B072FK63LP,R32UC6282XYJND,"July 18, 2018",5,"Comfortable, great-quality, and classic","These shoes are super comfy. I've been looking for some perfect work shoes for a while and I think I've found them! I haven't worn them on a shift yet, but they feel like they'll hold up well. The soles have good grip and seem slip-resistant, so that's good. Sweat might be a bit of an issue in the future, but they have two tiny air holes on the side that'll definitely help with ventilation. The shoes have roomier toes than most, and feel great on the heel--you kind of bounce as you walk in them. Even if I for some reason don't end up wearing these to work, I'll still wear them as regular flats. I bought these expecting to return them because of sizing, but they fit perfect. I'm usually either a 9.5W or a 10 regular, so I got the size 10 despite some reviewers saying that they run large. These fit me pretty perfectly, so I would say that they run right on target! :) (Side note: if you're a clumsy walker like me and you always roll your ankles, be aware that these shoes seem particularly prone to that sort of thing. so be on the lookout!)"

The soles do make noises on hardwood/tile floor, but seems to be drowned out or even lessened as the day goes on. Back of the heels have started to rub a little - slight concern of blisters, but overall they are super lightweight and comfy. The look professional enough to get away with as ""dress shoes"". Also, a little sweaty, but this may improve with use as well. Glad I got them! Thanks1"

I ordered the size 7M, which is suppose to be a women's size 9. I don't know why it says M for a woman's shoe but it does. I received it tonight and it's a women's size 7, not a 9.

I ordered them in 8W. Now, I don’t have the widest feet per say, but I usually do get my work shoes with a little extra wiggle room because it’s more comfortable for me. When they arrived they were in a clear plastic bag which I thought odd. After taking them out I noticed that there was a slight difference in the shape of the opening of the shoes where your foot slides in. The right one had a wider opening than the left. I didn’t think much of it and wore them to work that night. I kept wearing them for about a month and a half. My feet usually don’t hurt after work, but with these shoes they were killing me. I started getting back pain where I didn’t have any before which I assume was from the lack of support in the shoe. The shoes were DEFINITELY not wide and pinched my toes together so much so that my toenails started cutting into my skin and before I knew it they were swollen and red all of the time and tender to touch. I’ve never had an issue like this before. Since I had already worn them I didn’t think that returning them was an option, and I wore them for so long because shoes aren’t cheap and I had to wait to make enough money to replace these things. If you’re on your feet for more than a couple of hours at a time and don’t have extremely narrow feet I would highly recommend Crocs bistro shoes. I got them as a replacement for these and have no complaints at all!"

Super comfy, fit perfectly (which never happens since I'm always in half sizes), and looks good. If you dont tell someone its a croc, I bet they wouldnt know. And they do squeak a bit, but I think if I wear them around to wear them out a bit, and wear socks, it should stop. Ive had similar ones (not as comfy) and they stopped after a bit.

Well They gave me blisters after only a few hours of where. I have to find some socks or something to make these shoe work. Besides that They felt great I was so sad. I am not giving up on these shoes. Update. After getting some no show socks in black I love these shoes. They are really great I just had some rubbing on the sides of my foot when I did not have the socks on. Socks or any panty hose will fix the problem. I love these shoes now.

It hits me right at the tip of my toe of my bigger foot. I did not go up a size out of fear of clown size clogs plus I heard these can stretch with manipulation. I’m more concerned with how sweaty my toes get. I thought these shoes circulate air. Outside on a windy day they’re great but I wear these at work in a jail. I find myself taking them off under my desk. Not smelly just hot. They are comfortable though and I get compliments on the look but I’m also asked about sweatiness.

I love crocs, and was looking to wear something nicer than athletic shoes in the kitchen & serving lines. These fit the bill! I am a size 10 in most crocs and these run a little on the wide side, which is EXACTLY what I was hoping for.  If you loved wearing crocs Malindi or Jayna, these are very similar. The only down side is i find my feet do sweat in these more than any other crocs I've worn. The 2 tiny ventilation holes in the arch are pretty minimal, and I dont wear socks with this shoe due to the style and snug fit. Hosiery or trouser socks might do ok though.

I bought a size 10 which was too big and thought maybe a 9.5 would have worked better. The crocs website says to just order the next whole size down if you are a half size since they don’t carry half sizes, so I ordered size 9 as well but I’m not happy with it. They squish my toes a little bit. I still wear these to work and I will say they are extremely comfortable and they do not make my feet smell the way regular ones do. I’m also able to wash these which I really like. I wouldn’t recommend these if you are a 1/2 size but for whole sizes I would."

I have bruising on both feet from wearing these. I have a sit down job,  there shouldn't be so much pain or bruises. They didn't have a 7.5 so I went up to a 8. Then, I decided to size down to 7s. Neither shoe did what I wanted- a comfortable firm shoe for a desk position. I didn't realize how sensitive my feet are until this experience.  I am returning both 8 and 7.5.

I have a slightly wide foot and I feel like it moves around in the shoe a lot at first. More importantly though, the shoe doesn’t breath so your foot sweats a lot for long term wear and makes it even more difficult to walk in. I LOVE crocs. They are ugly as hell but so incredibly comfortable. I mostly wear their flip flops and thought I would try some for work. Great concept but execution needs tweaking."

Is there a knife in my shoe? :'^(,"Very comfortable on the heels of my feet, I work full time walking around on tile floors all day & expected the foot sweating based on previous reviews, if you wear no show footie socks, that helps a lot. Now, I have a larger bunion on the sides of my toes than normal, I wear wide width shoes. THESE KILLED MY BUNIONS in the toe area. I had to use a box cutter to carve out some of the inner layers to make it more comfortable and not as tight. So far that has helped greatly and I'm happier with these shoes now. I've had them around a week before writing this review. If you have a more narrow/normal foot, then these are perfect."

I wore them to cook in a kitchen before I realized it so I won't try to return them. They're well-made shoes though - Work Crocs are industry standard for a reason. They're so good + slip-resistant I still grin + bear it when it's time to clean the floors, so I don't fall on my behind."

These silver crocs are great because they coordinate with every color.  My patients love them and like to call them my “astronaut or moon shoes”. I’ll admit, Crocs aren’t the most fashionable shoes. They basically look like something an elf would wear, but they are ridiculously comfortable and very easy to clean. Since these are the bistro crocs, they have “no slip” soles and don’t have any holes like the original crocs, they meet all of the proper shoe requirements for my job.  I usually wear a women’s size 7 1/2  shoe. Since these don’t come in half sizes, I went with size 8 Women’s/6 Men’s. They are a little bit large on me, so I have some extra toe space. The back strap is very comfortable and holds my feet securely. The foot bed is firm enough for very good arch support, but soft enough to absorb the impact from walking.  They are so comfortable that even after a 12 hr shift, my feet don’t hurt."

They are not cushy and supportive at all, the soles are different than all my other Crocs. The toe box is narrower than my other Crocs too. The only good thing is the colors, they are very cool looking, but will be expensive house shoes, feet hurt even wearing them around the house. Update: Wore them to work and my feet were not killing my by the end of the day so that is good, and everyone noticed them and loved them. They are really great colors. Only wish they were wide and cushy like my other Crocs and a bit lower in cost."

Very roomy, but not flopping on my feet. Work crocs are less cushiony than my 10yr old original crocs. However they are considerably more substantial. Similiar to roomy work boots in feel and support. I use heel strap for walking, not for lounging. Due to my work related back injury, i need that extra cushion and support, so i added good cushioned work insoles. My first try-on i also am wearing double thick hunting socks, to check warmth factor for all season wear. These crocs pass all tests with flying colors..no pun intended. Extremely happy with my purchase. Cushioned insoles may sound rediculous, but work REALLY WELL! Get a pair. Or two."

Where the strap hooks in...on the inside of the shoe...it was digging at my foot. Apparently they are a BIT NARROW...compared to the other 4 pairs of crocs I have because that 'button' is not a problem on those. But I was never going to use the strap so I just popped them right off...problem solved! The 'holes' along each side are not punched out like they are on other crocs and my feet were getting sweaty in our 90 degree heat. So I took a small pocket knife and carefully cut out the indents and now i can get some air flow thru there and they are much cooler on my feet. I love the tie dyed look and these are quite comfortable now.

On the other hand dirt and shumtz don't get in them when gardeing. So I'm still weighing my options!

They stick out with nearly every outfit in a good way. They look great and come with all of the classic benefits of normal Crocs. While wearing them you can expect them to feel comfortable, look great, have good traction, and keep water out. First of all, nearly every pair of Crocs are made to be extremely comfortable and something that you would want to wear all day. The unique design of these look great and make you stand out from the crowd. The traction on these is great as they are made to be non-slip and non-marking, which makes them great for anyone in the nursing field or any other field that requires non-slip non-marking shoes. One thing that separates these Crocs from the others is the lack of holes all over the shoe. This gets rid of some of the breathability of the shoe but in return they keep water out better and you can wear them in the snow. This is also another place where it helps for if you have a job that requires you to have close toed shoes. A slight downside to them being close toed is that if you do get water in them it does not drain out and will stay in the shoe with your foot until you dry it off or take it off.  If you are buying these be aware that they are a little bit roomy, so it might be a good idea to order half a size down from your normal shoe size. Also, as I have worn these for a few months now they have held up excellently. There is almost no wear on the sole yet and there is no cracking of the visuals anywhere around the shoe. So, if you are looking for a pair of shoes for this upcoming spring, I would highly recommend getting a pair of these or a similar pair of Crocs to take your outfit to the next level."

I continued to have pain in my calf's and heels and a Dr. told me because my job involves so much walking I should try Crocs and I have never looked back.

So every year I am looking for new and exciting replacements however  these had a strange feeling when I first put them on they felt too short until I maneuvered my foot around and they felt better. I also noticed the bottoms are not the normal design of all my previous Crocs these have a smaller pattern I am hoping they are not going to be slippery.

Be aware of the different ""fits"".  Alaways shop on crocs.com and then purchase here for faster shipping and easier returns.  But basically  Roomy fit crocs all fit like the OG crocs,  The standard fit is far more narrow and if you have wide feet you will not be able to wear them,  then there is the middle fit which is relaxed.  depending on your feet and the croc you may like or not like.  Some pairs I can wear them others I can't.  I suggest trying on in store to see if they will work for you.  Most slides and loafers are just too tight for my feet.  But like the reviva's will actually stretch a bit and break in.  I guess what I'm trying to say is not all crocs fit the same so be aware of that when ordering.  They really need to offer crocs lock on more pairs though.  At the very least they should make the Specialist and specialist vents with it as they need a vented pair to go with bistros or they need to create a bistro vent pair.

Unfortunately these shoes made my feet hurt like nothing else!

And factoring in other reviews I ordered down 1/2 a size.  The length was just right but the width was way too wide. I wanted these to use for garden shoes because of the closed toe feature and the fact that they  are so lightweight. Ended up sending these back and getting some sloggers (better fit but quite a bit heavier). These crocs would be good for someone with super wide feet or who wants a really loose fit."

I find them very comfortable although there is not any significant arch support. The toe straps are connected through rubber side walls, the placement may not be comfortable for all feet. Easy to wipe clean ( I use a mr clean sponge). These run true to size. The nubs on the footbed are a little more stiff than usual and take a little getting used to, even wearing other nub sole crocs these are harder and did make my toes feel tender the first couple wears. The overall look is much more feminine than others. I found that. Any styles also have a strap that cross angles the top of the foot, for me this causes leg cramping and bruising to my foot, this is one is perfect since it only crosses toes and ankle."

I really wanted some strappy sandals that would stay on my feet if it rained that I wouldn't slip out of.  I had thee pleasure of trying this exact style on in a store so buying online was no problem.  They are very comfortable, the straps do not dog in anywhere and I found them to not be too wide or too narrow.  I will say that I normally wear a size 9, but when I tried the 8, I thought I could fit those too, but when I walked that's when my heel was on the edge on the shoe so I stayed true to my size 9 and they don't feel overly big whatsoever.  If you're a true half size person like 8.5, then I would size down for sure. I normally wear 9 exclusively so it made sense to buy a size 9.  What I like about these is that the velcro straps don't catch on my toes or ankle anywhere and since it's adjustable, I can make them tighter or looser with plenty of space and they are made well. If you are someone with wide feet like my mother, she cannot wear these as they are too narrow."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Webbing Sandal,B07FKJYM8M,R1YTLVKHHVY5P6,"August 8, 2018",4,Great for casual wear,"I took a chance on these fitting my wide feet, as the strap on the toes is fully adjustable.  The straps are just barely long enough for my wide feet and high bridge, but they work.  The plastic where the straps attach to the shoe are a little rigid and could be problematic, but I bought a half-size too big to give a little extra room.  They're comfortable for casual wearing and will be great for beach vacation shoes, but I wouldn't want to go for a long walk in them.  It's just a piece of rubber between your feet and the concrete sidewalk with no cushioning."

I will return due to lack of arch support, but sadly because they were the best looking."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Webbing Sandal,B07FKJYM8M,R3UQXMNPIHGZ8J,"July 30, 2018",5,"Summer sandal wears day and night, wet or dry","Have not worn this sandal before and within 24 hours I've worn it at least 12 hours.  Very comfortable, does not slip and slide in water, stays put on the foot, has good traction both in the sole and on the bottom.  Straps are adjustable and do not rub or have rough spots that bother, a plus when feet are not exactly the same right to left.  Wish I had bought them prior to other Crocs sandals that are slippery when wet.  Sizing is spot on, size 8 is normally what I buy for any sandal.  Price point is good as this is a solidly made, well constructed wet/dry summer sandal for any lady, young or not so young."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Webbing Sandal,B07FKJYM8M,R1V5ERBQB41TLZ,"June 8, 2018",5,but these were just too big - they looked like duck feet on me,"These sandals are really cute, especially for Crocs!  I usually wear a 9 in Crocs (8.5-9 in most shoes), but these were just too big - they looked like duck feet on me.  I returned them and got an 8, which is a much better fit (but I wouldn’t want them any shorter).  I have very narrow feet, and I like the closer fit of these.  I am happy that Crocs is getting into light weight, more feminine shoes, in addition to the ridiculously comfortable and convenient original clown shoes!"
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Webbing Sandal,B07FKJYM8M,RIKQBDQEFRWRZ,"May 31, 2018",3,Arch fell short,"I ordered these for my daughter.  She generally likes to wear Teva sandals in the summer.  These are a similar style, but she did not like them as much.  There is not a good arch like there is in a Teva sandal.  That aside, these are pretty light shoes and they adjust very easily.  The straps stay put and keep these sandals secure on your feet.  If you need good arch support I would suggest looking at Teva or Chaco.  Otherwise, these are nice overall sandals."

I WISH i could wear them everywhere like to work even, which I have but they are too casual to wear every day. Which is why i recently bought the crocs leigh wedge's and I cant wait to receive them since I LOVE these shoes so much!!  These are the best sandals I have ever worn and i suffer from plantar facsiitis.  They DO NOT hurt my feet and support my feet perfectly. I wear them everywhere, like to the beach and river, hiking, biking, walking my dogs, around the house, running errands, you name it.  etc."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Webbing Sandal,B07FKJYM8M,R3D56ZK949CBL0,"April 7, 2018",4,I love the look of these sandals,"I love the look of these sandals. They are very comfortable and I hope to wear them often. As with all my reviews for crocs shoes, my only complaint would be their sizing. I wear a 7 1/2, and as we all know, crocs only come in whole sizes, so I order size 7.  Because of that, I can only wear crocs open toe shoes and sandals, or my big toes hurt from the 1/2 size smaller. Maybe one day they will understand and start making 1/2 sizes. I’m sure it would help their business and they would sell many more shoes. I know o would be a happy girl and they would get more of my money."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Webbing Sandal,B07FKJYM8M,R1YA1073XKOWZ5,"May 27, 2019",5,Crocs are a lifesaver for me...,"Love these sandals! I can only wear crocs right now because I have plantar fasciitis, and neuropathy in my lower legs and feet. Nothing seemed to work, I hated wearing any kind of shoe. My Dr suggested I try crocs . They have such a variety! Plantar fasciitis is almost completely relieved, neuropathy so much improved. The little nubs in the footbed of the shoe keeps my feet “alive” and I feel great all day. No more painful feet for me . I have several different pairs of sandals, traditional crocs, and I am thankful for this footwear!"
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Webbing Sandal,B07FKJYM8M,R3QJPZL15ZHH1F,"March 15, 2019",5,Perfect for narrow feet!,"My daughter is a nightmare to fit for shoes.  She has incredibly narrow feet, narrow bridge and small heels.  She has to wear shoes that are narrow or special ordered because most stores no longer carry narrow selections.  I had originally purchased these for me, but as most crocs are amazing for slab footed women like myself, these were made for small pixie feet.  With huge excitement, I sent mine back and ordered a size smaller for my daughter hoping that my summer sandal nightmare would be over for the year.  These are perfect.  Not only does her foot stay put and not slide around a too big foot bed, but they are comfortable and actually quite cute.  I may order her another pair in a color just for fun!  So thrilled with this purchase and she loves them.  Hasn't taken them off!!!"
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Webbing Sandal,B07FKJYM8M,R2E7RMHYK9ZJW1,"July 9, 2019",5,Love it!,"The plastic part next to the pinky toe was not comfortable at the beginning but I tried to wear it at home couple of times. And did mini walks outside to see if that part would bother again. After couple of weeks of wearing everyday, going for 3mile hikes it is absolutely my favorite. I tried couple of famous brand sandals. They are mostly so bulky, heavy, high heeled or so expensive. This one is so far my favorite. Once they got wet and dried really fast. It is pretty light and has sleek design, adjustable straps. I wear 8 and size 8m fits perfectly. Really nice to be able to feel like barefoot walking but there is enough support and soft sole to feel comfortable"

I only wore them for a short amount of time but they felt super comfy!! The dots on the inside of the shoe left my feet feeling relaxed and pleasantly tingly when I took then off...almost like I'd just taken them out of a hot water soak (yes, you read that right.) I love Crocs, this has got to be my 15-20th pair. I now have my fiance loving them!!"
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Webbing Sandal,B07FKJYM8M,R1S2AC7JRXXVUR,"September 9, 2019",5,Adjustability of both ankle and bridge of foot make these perfect.,"I have narrow ankles but my feet are wide at their widest point. So I appreciate the ability to adjust both. Also, I really have hated the ""nubs"" on the surface of other Crocs that I've had, but these are more tolerable. Great sandals for launching canoes from shallow water or for showering if you don't trust your environment. I'd recommend ordering the lightest color because I tend to use this in fairly sunny conditions, and they don't heat up the way darker ones do."

I bought them for my trip and I knew I was going to be in and out of the beach. So, instead of purchasing water shoes (which I hate), I decided to give these a try. They were perfect! I was able to leave them on without worrying about sand being stuck in my shoes. I also walked in them all day at a water/amusement park from 8am until 7pm and they did not hurt one bit. I'm a size 7 in women and they are true to size."

The 8 barely fit, so I kept the 9. I've worn them sailing, to the beach, in camp while backpacking, even around town. They are so comfortable, and the velcro makes them easy to put on and take off. They are incredibly light (but sturdy) and dry very quickly. And pretty stylish for Crocs! I'll never buy Keens, Tevas, or Chacos again."
Crocs,Women's Swiftwater Webbing Sandal,B07FKJYM8M,R7X9IXY0IW4JJ,"July 29, 2019",4,Great boat shoes,"Bought these specifically for boating/swimming. I wear a size 8 and they fit perfectly. I was worried about the straps rubbing my feet in an uncomfortable way since they are thinner, but I've had no problems. While I use them as water shoes, they aren't the best for that purpose (I've seen some people asking about that). The only con is that the white gets dingy pretty fast. Mine were stained after just a few wears. Overall these were worth the money!"

Crocs,Women's Coast Clog,B01J99J34G,R14GMI1U6L309A,"May 19, 2018",5,Second pair I've owned.,"So last summer I decided to pull the trigger and try a pair of crocs.  I went with the off-road style because I walk around town a lot and they seemed to have more shoe to wear down. My feet are technically a 9 (men's), leaning more toward a 9 1/2, but I always buy 10 because I like extra toe room.  The off-road style has an adjustable velcro back strap, and I had them dialed in about half way, so I was concerned about buying a 10 in this style since there's no adjustment to be had.  My worries were not necessary, as the 10 fits just as comfortably as I needed it to. And for anyone asking what the difference is between these and the ""Classic Clogs,"" as far as I can tell, the only difference is that the classics have more holes on the toe of the shoe, as these only have two on each side. Very happy with this.  Going to keep using my off-roads for hiking and longer walks, while reserving these for less intensive activities around town."
Crocs,Women's Coast Clog,B01J99J34G,R3549H2MHMFXBF,"August 6, 2018",3,"Runs narrow and a little short, minimal arch support","I bought these in mint size 9/11. I have one pair of 8/10 classic crocs and a few 9/11 classic crocs. The sizing in general is very inconsistent, even within the same style/size of classic clogs. These however are definitely on the narrow side and thankfully I read reviews before I bought these and went with the bigger size. I wanted the mint color, which is cheaper than the classic, and wanted to try this style with less holes on the front. Also worth mentioning is that the arch is significantly lower than the classic, almost nonexistent, and that may be important to some especially those who buy these because they have foot problems. The lack of arch support is noticeable as soon as you slide your foot in but I've barely walked around in them at all yet so I can't say if they will hurt my feet after standing for long periods. My particular pair was made in Vietnam. Some other reviews had said the ones made in Vietnam were of less comfortable material or one croc was smaller than the other. I didn't have that issue as mine were the same size and seemed to be of similar quality to the made in Mexico ones I have."
Crocs,Women's Coast Clog,B01J99J34G,R15I9AWVM22GZN,"July 2, 2018",4,Just a bit tighter that regular Crocs.,"I bought this iteration of the classic clog because they are solid in front and not shove dirt onto my toes.  They work good in that aspect.  However, they are a bit narrow.  On the croc site they list widths as regular, relaxed and roomy.  For some reason amazon does not include this information consistently and the croc site doesn't even mention the coast variety.  These I would say are ""relaxed"" and because I have circulation issues, I'd rather have ""roomy"".  I will keep these and wear them for short periods of time.  I must say that Croc make a fantastic line of products."

HOWEVER, am disappointed...have a pair with openings all 'round that i've had for years...first thing i do when i step in the door is put those on.  they are soft and squishy in the most perfect way.  the NEW ones are hard and the ridges/bumps inside make it feel as tho i have sand in my shoes...ick and big sigh.  i don't know if they will soften up with time or as with so much else these days they've switched to cheaper materials and now they're inferior.  anyone have an opinion on this?  whether the OLDER ones are spongier which give a feeling of just walking on a cloud?  also.  has anyone had a pair that just dried up and crumbled?  i had a pair for gardening i picked up at goodwill or somewhere and they were nice and brown like dirt.  but even with duck taping they finally crumbled."
Crocs,Women's Coast Clog,B01J99J34G,R65QL2W40618O,"July 25, 2018",5,Great shoes that do just what I need them to do!,"I have a pair of Dawgs insulated slippers that are very similar to Crocs. Have had them for a few years and love them but they are waaay too warm to wear in the summer. Unfortunately my flip flops were terrible for walking in wet grass to check the garden. Once they were wet they were wet for most, if not all day and were also slippery to try to walk in. These are my 1st pair of official Crocs and so far I'm loving them. Exactly what I was wanting. Easy to slip on and head out to the yard and slip off when you come in so you aren't tracking dirt/grass/water around the house. I like how you can use the strap if you need it or just swivel it up out of the way if you don't. The grippy texture inside makes it much better walking around if you happen to get water inside the shoe and they dry out fairly quickly. It's great to be able to just rinse them off quick if they get any dirt or grass on them-which is minimal since not much sticks to them either."
Crocs,Women's Coast Clog,B01J99J34G,RSZU2A6RG192L,"January 21, 2019",2,NOT A GOOD FIT,"I have had several Croc's in the past and they are my favorite shoe as far as comfort goes.  I have always given them five stars (except for one pair that the trim is peeling off and I gave it a 4 star for that reason).  However, this one only gets two stars.  There is something wrong with the way this pair fits.  They feel a little bigger than most and the arch doesn't fit in the correct place on my foot even tho they are the same size I always buy.  And for some reason when I wear socks with this pair I always end up with a hole in the heel.  Probably because my foot slides around in them due to the poor fit.  I would think all Croc's would fit the same as long as the size was the same.  But not so with this style.  I don't know if they have changed all Croc's or just this style.  Very disappointed in this pair and a waste of hard earned money.  I will probably buy another pair but if I have this problem again it will be my last Croc's purchase."

The smaller darker color makes them a bit more bearable for me when I look down, lol. OMG, they really are comfy. My normal size is a 7-7.5W but these accommodate wide feet naturally and the 7 will probably fit socks if needed too.. This is my first pair & I bought them to leave near the door to throw on when the dog needs to be walked or I take my work dress shoes off and easily cleaned when it's muddy. I would definitely bring them camping or hiking for when I take my hiking boots off. As ugly as they made my feet look, they do take the place of water shoes, flip flops, and slippers in the summer for trips!"

I have worn many Crocs exclusively for day-long comfort for more than 10 years. I've returned the first shoes because the size was too large. I'll be returning two more pair because the combined size,-comfort-appearance are simply not acceptable. Newly purchased (same size) Mexican-made Crocs from a different retailer (not via Amazon) are the difference between tired-sore feet from Vietnam and complete all-day comfort from Mexico."

I like that my new pair had a closed up toe so that walking in the rain did not drag in water to my toes.  I will revert to one with ventilation holes as the weather warms.  They were comfortable as expected, feet do not get cold, and the main reason I bought, they do not set off the xray machines when going through them for a grand jury service of four weeks.

Crocs,Women's Coast Clog,B01J99J34G,R1D8S4A6UL54SV,"December 8, 2018",5,Great for camping,I got these for camping/backpacking and they have been great so far. They are wide enough to wear them with heavy socks on cold evenings but not so large that they slide off. I have only ever gotten the generic brand before so I am unable to compare them with other Croc brand models. I love the fact that they are easy to clean and they work great as shower shoes. I am excited to use the on my next backpacking trip. The fabric ones I brought last time got very wet/muddy and added unnecessary weight to the pack. These will not have that problem.  They are a bit too large to fit inside the pack but they could easily be tied to the outside without much difficulty.

However they rub on the inside of my right ankle, chafing my skin there. It could be the shape of my particular ankle, but that makes these uncomfortable in that location as a result. I can't wear them long or I blister. I wish these were softer in that area so they had more flexibility to shape themselves to the particulars of each foot."

Brand new, they were very stylish. I really enjoyed the shoes. That being said, I bought these for work. I'm in IT and our floors are concrete. If I walk in the city for lunch, it's less than 1mile a day on sidewalk, if at all. After about 5 months of daily semi-daily wear to work (where I mostly sit down), the tread on the bottom of these shoes disappeared. The lightweight effect is a trade-off for durable tread. Nike's shoes made for walking/running never did this to me (except for long distance hikes for 1-2 years). I was walking on the sidewalk a morning after rain the night before and fell flat on my ass! The tread is mostly worn off the in the parts where there is 0 visible remaining tread, there are actually divers which I believe are capable of growing into actual holes.

Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B004Y6PQBE,R3IMZIFMVQBV6R,"December 5, 2017",5,Footbed is very comfortable; toe area very little room,9/18/2019 UPDATE: I still love the shoes but I’ve realized after owning many pair that there is very little room in the front of the shoe (toe area). I didn’t realize just how little room there was until I washed them and they shrunk A LOT! I’ve always washed my athletic shoes but I’ve never had a pair shrink as much in the front as these did. I did use a shoe stretcher and it helped a little bit. I have planters faciatis and my feet hurt all the time. But this is my second pair of Nike Tanjun. They’re the most comfortable athletic shoes I have ever had and I plan to order more colors.

Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B004Y6PQBE,R1CVF8B2DVCF5M,"July 3, 2018",2,No arch support or padding,"I was trying to find a running shoe with arch support but these have absolutely none, as they are all fashion and no function. The footbed is hard and flat as a board (see pics). If anything they make your foot overpronate because the inside arc of the outer shoe is fashionably carved out. They are cute but I would mess up my feet pretty bad running in these. Mine also came with a perforation in the toe area so I’ll probably end up returning. Not the quality of “running shoe” one would expect after dropping $80."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B004Y6PQBE,R24JS2PP0WD5SP,"April 10, 2019",2,too small with bad seams,"i’m super disappointed. these shoes are very narrow and small. my shoe size is an 8.5, always dead on, and so i ordered an 8.5 and unfortunately they were too small and tight. there was also a ridge on the instep sean (right under the arch) and it was really uncomfortable to walk on. i submitted a return. if you have narrow feet, order a half size up and these will probably work fine for you. they were awful for me. the design is darling (i ordered the black with rose gold detail) and i sooo wish they’d worked for me. looks just like the image. arrived on time as well, just terribly sized. also - i went to a local dsw and found this same shoe (same price) and tried it on in a 9 just for kicks.. the toe area was more acceptable, however there was still an uncomfortable ridge on the instep."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B004Y6PQBE,R5VFR5D21VDQ8,"June 28, 2019",5,Comfy and great fit,"This wasn't on Prime. I was given an ETA of 2 weeks and yet it arrived 5 days earlier than expected which made me really happy! It fits well. Love the colour. I've only used it for my trips to the store so far and they have been comfortable. Would love to see how they hold up with more intense activities. Overall, I am very pleased and satisfied with my purchase."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B004Y6PQBE,R2Y6BWJDKEHAAX,"August 18, 2019",2,Horrible shoes,"I don't know if I've ever given a poor review like this. I bought the black tanjuns with gray swish. I loved the color at first. But maybe they are not real tanjuns, as they are COMPLETELY different from my previous pairs. They fit REALLY oddly. The toe box is so strange that it makes a flopping noise when I walk. The shoe is not shaped correctly, at least not for a women, and comes up too high near the ankle and really hurts to walk in. The fabric is very different from previous pairs, made with what seems like a super cheap material. I don't understand how these are even sold."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B004Y6PQBE,RYM5EWYKSIJ8F,"December 3, 2018",5,Great price for these shoes!,"I like NIKE.  Ordered an 8 1/2 and they fit perfectly!  Great material, enough toe room and black color looks dressy.  I can’t wear heels anymore, very flat feet and because of 2 herniated discs in my lower back with nerve damage down my left leg and left foot, only these shoes will do."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B004Y6PQBE,RYPMRWVK6C12F,"November 20, 2018",2,Disappointed,I bought those sneakers for a special volunteering job. They made me trip every time I wore them. They were catching on the floor and I am glad I did not fall... and break a hip or a hand  I had to go and buy another pair from another brand... Something in the way the soles were manufactured was not right for all kinds of flooring. Buyers beware!!!
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B004Y6PQBE,R3BCMUTM2ZNY2I,"July 14, 2018",4,ONLY TOLERABLE NIKE IN WIDE,bought a 7EE and a 6.5 reg width for comparison and because the EE only comes in black. SAME FOOTBED AND SOLE! but the extra wide had more mesh upper material and was significantly roomier. keeping both cuz they are cute but the EE more tolerable and accomodated a bunion. had to break them in for a day or so but good shoe for nike which does not cater to special orthopedic needs.  these are the only nike shoes i can wear comfortably.
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B004Y6PQBE,R17OJKHJH1OX5A,"August 26, 2018",5,Best Shoe Ever,"It’s a really great fit I have big feet and this shoe is perfect plus, when I walk I can feel the breeze coming into my shoe making it feel more relaxed and these shows are great for work and I stand a lot and walk around a lot to help people out. Still, these shoes are amazing and I can’t wait to use them in the gym I really needed shoes for the gym and I heard these guys were great to wear at the gym to workout. I highly recommend getting the shoes."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B004Y6PQBE,R1TN4VN0SAYK3,"October 1, 2018",5,extremely comfortable!!,"I read other reviews of women who had foot problems and these shoes helped their feet. Well, I'm all in on that conclusion. These are the best shoes I've had in eons. I definitely recommend these shoes and will definitely buy another pair. As a side benefit, the other night I spilled tea and some of iit got  on my shoe. I took a damp sponge and wiped it off -- good as new!! Worth every penny."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B004Y6PQBE,R2KJPYSMAL7QZW,"October 4, 2019",5,All Day Comfort!,"I am extremely pleased with the delivery and the product!  These shoes have saved my life!  I work part-time for a network and several times per year we have to work at different shows.  Well, I have tried every show from less expensive to very expensive and by day two and definitely by day 4 (because of the extended walking and standing required) my feet and legs hurt so bad that I wanted to cut my legs off at the knee and sit them on the side! Lol. I am literally on my feet for 8-16 hours per day! So, I went online and typed “most comfortable Nike shoe,” and this one popped up, and the reviews were on target!  I can honestly say that these are the most comfortable shoe I could have ever purchased!  The only thing I would mention is that they run about a 1/2-1 size too small.  I purchased the first pair from Nike and when I went back to purchase a larger size they were out of stock.  Fortunately they were available from another vendor and I was able to get them delivered before I left for my trip."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B004Y6PQBE,R15EJBQODWFTIS,"June 30, 2018",5,So comfy!!,"Soooo comfy! The first pair of shoes I have worn that were comfortable from the second I stepped into them!  Great breath ability too.  I have very wide feet, high arches and insteps. Nike shoes NEVER fit me properly because they usually have a very narrow toe box. I ordered the extra wide (2E) and they don't need to be broken in or worn a few days to feel good.  They are the best tennis shoes I think I have ever worn!!!"
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,R1THPQGYSI6RAJ,"May 20, 2019",1,Nike does nt stand behind their product for 30 day return for FULL REFUND as advertised!,"I expected a shoe worthy of its' name!  It is sad to see that such a big company could not stand behind their product that had to be returned because of such discomfort!  I will never purchase another Nike product - I know this does not bother such a big company, but I will share my experience as often as I can."

AndI used to have Nike epic react the first one my favorite shoes for Marathon training I ran about 900 miles with that shoes and still in good shape! The epic react 2 its the same as best as the first one in my opinion trust me , highly recommend!!"

All of my athletic shoes for years have been Nike. All of them are size 7. So I bought these in a 7 as well. They are super cute and comfy when first put on. However, every time I wear these for a run I get horrible blisters on my heals. Such a waste of money..."
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,R299085XRZ0O2Q,"April 30, 2019",5,A bit big,Runs a little big. Tried these on in the store and they fit perfect but I got these online in the color I liked and they are a bit big But nice after I put an Insole in. Didn’t enjoy the price being that they are expensive and then the added $50 for a good insole.
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,R2N5ZE92CJ8NB5,"April 16, 2019",5,I'm hardly a professional,"But these sneakers fit me perfectly. I like a snug fit  when I run-no sliding around, and that's what I got ordering my normal 11.5 men's. I only run about a half hour 3-4 times a week, so I can't tell you if these are great for a marathon, but exactly what I needed to cushion the impact of running on pavement."
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,R3VSBLBYZCT4FL,"September 10, 2019",5,Great for running long distances!,"This shoe did the trick for me in this year’s Fort Lauderdale half marathon in February. I had plantar fasciitis and almost could not participate in the h. Marathon because the crash pad on my other Nike Shield running shoes had crashed right two weeks before the race. I was only able to test them out for 3 miles before race day so I was scared when I had to run 13.1 miles in the React. Fortunately the arch, toe box and heels were so well supported that, together with  Nike dri fit socks I got NO blisters,I sized up from s 9 to 9.5 because of the jamming of running on the front of the shoe and that was smart,"
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,R2Y77YFGJU1E8,"November 15, 2019",5,These are in my Top 2 for Shoe of the Year for 2019!!!,"Okay, to begin this is my 3rd pair of Nike Flyknit Epic React, and I really do live each and every one of them! I love the Look, the Fit and Feel, the Aesthetics, the Color Ways, I love the unparalleled cushioning... its just an over all amazing shoe! Nike hit it out of the Park with this one. I have read a few comments saying that they ""run a little small, so you should size up""... I dont recomend this. The size for each of my Epic Reacts have been spot on perfect! I personally believe what happened is that many people are not used to Flyknits, and when they first put the shoes on, it may feel slight snug. This will go away in less than an Hour of wearing the shoes. Anyway, I recomend d this shoe for anyone and everyone! It really doesnt matter what you are using them for, you will love them! (PS... The Nike Flyknit Epic React Pegasus is also an AMAZING SHOE, and it might even have a better ""fit & feel"" to them, along with even better cushioning! )"
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,R2N19CZJIM0SB,"June 1, 2019",4,"Run small, and not as plush, but great shoes!","I had to get a full size larger - from 10.5 to 11.5. They are not as plush as I thought, but I run in hokas so I’m spoiled. These are good middle distance middle speed running shoes though! The flyknit is super comfy."
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,R1L9GPKAYMEPTY,"May 27, 2018",5,Order half size bigger then normal.,This shoe is like walking on air. Best shoe I ever bought! Well worth the price. I can jog faster and for a longer period of time in them.  I would order a half size bigger because it hugs your foot like a sock.
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,R62Y5JYZHR7C3,"February 10, 2020",1,Shoes are not authentic Nike,"I don’t think the shoes I received were authentic. I was suspicious when I opened the box and saw the packaging. It was not packaged in a Nike box. Instead it was repackaged in “frustration free packaging.” I was further suspicious when I tried on the shoes and it didn’t fit right. Even though I ordered half size up they were really tight and width didn’t feel right. My suspicions were confirmed when I went to a Nike store and tired on several shoes in the exact same style, color, and size. The shoes I tried on in Nike store fit just right like it should and were comfortable with support as expected. The ones on amazon did not."
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,R2YABOEVYI5800,"October 20, 2018",5,Love the knit upper of this shoe!,"I love the fact that these shoes accommodate the joint disfiguration of my arthritis — no pressure points, feels good! I love the knit upper!! Brilliant.  It is very difficult to slide my foot into them, however — perhaps this will improve as they break in a bit more.  Overall, lovely!"
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,RMU6BMD37WG1U,"December 27, 2019",1,What you see is NOT what you get.,Be careful. The item description clearly says “Men’s”... so I ordered a Men’s 9 as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. A Women’s 9 is what showed up. I had to desperately go out shopping on Christmas Eve to find something else. I would not order again from this seller.
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,R1KQKP9G60IH9S,"July 22, 2019",3,Too tight,Had to return these because they were really tight on top of the foot. I would recommend ordering one size up.  I wear 7.5 and ordered a 7.5 and it was snug on top.

Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,RTEMQ1N30BW0B,"July 30, 2019",2,Didn’t like them,Sent them back the next day. I didn’t like the fact that there is no tongue and you have to slip your foot in. That doesn’t work for me.
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,R3DOBGCIZA1LG1,"July 28, 2019",4,Nice but a tight fit,My shoe size is 9.5 medium and I ordered these in 9.5 which is just right. I have major foot issues so I was looking for a more cushioned style and these don't have that much cushioning. I'll probably won't be able to use inserts either because the toe box is narrow. But since their fit is better than all the other sneakers I've tried on I'm keeping them.
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,R2LNO2OZDWWNDL,"January 31, 2020",1,Blister factories,"Even after short runs, these shoes blister the heck out of both ankles. I've tried several different socks, of varying length and thickness, and none help mitigate the blistering. The tread on the bottom has also worn down ridiculously quickly, given that I don't wear these very often. I would not recommend these shoes at all."
Nike,Women's Epic React Flyknit Running Shoe,B07M7W948G,RSK9I7RXC586D,"July 28, 2019",1,Really Bizarre Shoe!,"I bought an earlier version of this shoe-I guess- when I tried to order another, I got clicked through to this monster-so I ordered it-how bizarre-the earlier version had a tongue and was lace up. Not this version-no way could I fit my foot into this shoe! I cannot imagine how narrow a foot one must have to be able to fit into this shoe!"

Nike,Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes,B073NHB1VS,R2KG55QEM6MDWV,"December 14, 2018",5,Half size up :),"I have only run in them a couple of times, but so far they feel great. I normally wear a size 9, and I ordered a 9.5, and I’m glad I did. There is plenty of room, but not too much. The only thing that will take me getting used to is that they are slightly bulkier than my ASICS. Like any running shoes, I’m sure it will take a little bit of time to work out the stiffness and fully break them in, but they are amazing!"
Nike,Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes,B073NHB1VS,R3ARHFP10VRT4H,"August 26, 2018",5,Surprisingly comfortable,"I have a very hard time finding shoes that are comfortable for me, I have severe fibromyalgia with no help from medications because nothing works for me. So I am constantly looking for comfortable clothing and sneakers. Usually nike isnt good for me but after deciding to give this pair a try I was happy I did. Not only are they nice looking but they really are comfortable. I wore them all day today did a lot of walking and have zero issues with my feet hurting. Worth the extra money"

They are the most comfortable tennis shoes I own, I can be on my feet all day and they don't hurt.  I normally wear a 8.5 but in this shoe I wear a 9.  I find the toe box is wider and more comfortable especially if I wear a little thicker sock, it's just roomy enough to my toes are scrunched together.  I don't have a wide foot either."
Nike,Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes,B073NHB1VS,R11T0P77CCI59M,"August 2, 2017",5,Great shoes,This is my second pair. I think these shoes are comfy and aren't hard to keep looking fresh and white. I wear them to work every day and wash them about once a month and let them air dry. Love them.
Nike,Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes,B073NHB1VS,R1HFAOUG2TONCX,"July 15, 2019",5,Loving these shoes,"I'm really loving these shoe's. A little pricey. I'm on my feet a lot for work plus I  jog. I've worn them three times now and they're very comfortable. I wear a 6 1/2, purchase a 6 1/2, fits perfect. I like my shoes a little wide in the toe area.

Nike,Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes,B073NHB1VS,R1F99W8RVVP87D,"January 13, 2020",5,Great!,"I'm not really big into sneakers but I'm a fan of Nike and their activewear. When I saw these a few months ago, I HAD to have them. I usually only buy shoes that are black or black & white so this was a change for me. They're on the pricey side so for months I watched the price yo-yo. Right after the holidays they were the cheapest I've seen them, so I bought them! I had received them a few days ago. I wore them for the first time today and they were great! I'm normally a size 7 in women's shoes and one reviewer mentioned going up a half size, which ended up being a good idea so I ordered the 7. 5. Definitely very comfortable and I feel like it gives me a little bit of height (I'm 5'0 so I like it!). I love the colors! Can't wait to break them in!"
Nike,Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes,B073NHB1VS,RGPABPV5YK78F,"July 27, 2019",2,Haven't tried on Nike's in years,"Not a good fit for me.  The sole material is incredible stiff (hardly bendable). Compared to my old Gel Nimbus 16 Asics little front foot support for impact.  The heel fits fine ... shoe is tight around top of foot and toe box. I feel an odd bump in the ball of foot cushion.  Another half size up MIGHT do it (I always wear a 7 in running shoes and that's what I ordered), if it weren't for the other issues. I own a pair the original Nike's Lady running shoes from the 80's. They STILL fit perfectly!"
Nike,Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes,B073NHB1VS,R3GBFT9ZTC6T1B,"October 27, 2018",4,Perfect fit - Great product,I love these running shoes.  The only thing I will say is I wish I had worn socks with them.  Otherwise they are like walking on clouds.  I have circulation issues and these are the only shoes that don't pinch anywhere.  (rubbing on the arch of the foot is probably more to do with my foot than the shoe design it self).

Nike,Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes,B073NHB1VS,R3768B1IPDAEWZ,"May 14, 2019",4,Great shoes.,"Not shoes I wanted, but needed a pair I could actually walk in due to being pregnant and keeping up with my 2yr old outside. So I ordered these was bummed out till I received them I fell in love instantly I get so many compliments and when I say how much they cost people are wowed at how such great shoes are pricy, but not costing a arm and leg like most. However they do rub a little and are tight around the ankles (My ankles have not swollen yet only 3m along) SO I would least suggest socks that go a little above your ankle at least. I got a size 9 they are a little big on me so I would say order a size down or if you like the extra room get your normal size."

Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B001PDTO08,R1009KSBLHPT00,"July 18, 2019",5,In love!,"I'm so in love with these sneakers.  They're absolutely awesome.  I went ahead and order a 7.5 - typically I get an 8 for sneaker because of the whole sock situation, but because I find that Nike Cortez tends to run slightly on the large size (not my first pair) I'm glad that I went a half size smaller.  *I tend to go back and forth between 7.5 and 8 with both sneakers and heels*.  I have also narrow feet, so perhaps that's why the half size down worked for me too.  You can't tell on the picture, but I'm also wearing thin socks and I still had very roomie toe space. ** Also... these are Women's Size 7.5. ** I have to emphasize that because my other pair of Cortez's are men's size 6."

Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B001PDTO08,R2DI9JH4K07IMV,"March 1, 2018",5,"They feel comfortable enough, we all have a foot slightly bigger ...","They feel comfortable enough,we all have a foot slightly bigger than the other plus I have wide feet and was skeptical after the reviews but they fit great!. I wear heels every day, so I know that there are no perfect fit shoes. They are made of leather so I know the shoes will stretch. Over all "" They look super cool""! Can't wait to wear them :)"
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B001PDTO08,R1GX60MTJ4T0K1,"December 27, 2018",3,NOT comfy at all,"Not the quality I’d expect from Nike.  They feel a bit cheap, and the “leather” is a little wrinkled near the front, after only 2 days of wear. Minor, but annoying for the price I paid.  Plus this style is narrow and hurts my feet a LOT.  By the end of the work day, I was actually limping.  I got my normal size and my toes are right at the front, so it hurts my toes too. I gave my feet a few days to recover and tried wearing them again, but it was just as bad.  Guess I’ll donate them at this point.  NOT recommended if you want a comfy shoe."
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B001PDTO08,R8WV6UI51R4JP,"December 6, 2019",3,not comfortable,"I bought these as part of a uniform for a dance class. They are *not* comfortable, and if it were not for the required for a uniform thing, I would a) never have bought them in the first place, and b) returned them if for whatever reason, I had bought them. They make my feet ache. They are too wide in the back. My feet are pretty average width. They fit true to size in the sense that I wear a 6.75 (6.5 to 7, always buy 7s, or 37s in European sizing). There is little to no arch support, and certainly not enough. I ended up removing them halfway through the first two uses due to foot pain. And I wear 4""-5"" heels on a very regular basis. I wear Dr Martens and Birkenstocks. I'd pick all of those to walk a mile in over these shoes."
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B001PDTO08,R3S3CMJ8DJ8E34,"May 28, 2019",4,Just not for me,"It isn't easy to find shoes that fit my feet well and though these shoes are very pretty and seem to be well constructed, they are just not the shoes for me. I have very high arches and plantar fasciitis and even with arch supports they just don't feel good.  So I am returning them.  Sadly, though, because they are very pretty."
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B001PDTO08,R14G063ZXHZ2IU,"February 11, 2020",4,Mama said they was magic shoes!,"These are so great. They remind me of my youth! They were cool back then and they are cool now. They're not what I would call comfortable but they never were. The Cortez has zero arch support and is a narrow shoe. I wouldn't recommend these to someone with a wide foot. If you have a narrow foot, and you can get by without arch support, you can rock these bad boys! When I wear my Cortez I like to complete the look with other retro pieces like bell bottoms or retro t-shirts. I always get compliments on these and when I wear them I feel like a million bucks."
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B001PDTO08,R2XTNVMHQAQ2EB,"February 5, 2020",5,Nike classic leather shoe,"Delivered quickly. The shoe I got was black and white , not as the picture showed white and black. Also the description of material is different from the picture of leather , I wanted leather and read other reviews to make sure they were leather and not what the description of material was .  I love them even thought I thought they were white - I still give it five stars  because I am very pleased . Note if it says white and black it’s a white shoe .  If it says black and white it’s A black Shoe  , that’s my guess ...  Don’t go just by the picture ."
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B001PDTO08,RGV71SFG0DE5E,"June 22, 2019",5,Comfortable,"I normally get the classic look of white with black swoosh, but all they had in my size was the gold leaf style. I have gotten more compliments on this shoe than any other! This doesn’t look comfortable but they are great for all the walking I do! Normally you need to break in a shoe for a couple days but this one is good once you place your foot in it"
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B001PDTO08,R1NIHUYHCA0TDZ,"February 11, 2020",3,"Narrow at the top, but stylish","I wasn't sure what to expect from a leather trainer. I was disappointed at how tight and narrow it is in the top of the foot and toes area. There is little to no flexibility in this shoe. After about a month it started to relax but not ideal to walk for hours in. Max walking time without discomfort was 30 minutes, which at that point I have to take of the shoes.  Would suggest getting a half size bigger to avoid foot pressure."
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B001PDTO08,RVOZH5QGM8MOG,"December 7, 2019",1,Garbage Nike,The shoes look like they was put together by some children in a crafts class. The sole of the shoe was way off did not even fit them cut badly had no support at all. The material was  horrible it was two tone on one shoe. The laceses are garbage to thick and shredded really fast and the gold metal was tarnished after one ware. I do not believe these are a Nike product Nike should not stand by this shoe
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B001PDTO08,RDJ1NX4IE02H2,"November 8, 2019",5,Love them!,"These are simply the best shoes in the world. They bring back great memories. I don't buy leather products, so this was a good compromise. There is a tiny bit of leather byproduct in the outer shell, but the small amount is made from scrap leather that would probably just be thrown away. The bulk of the shoe is manmade. They run a little narrow, but that was perfect for me."
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B001PDTO08,R3ES3LLNKFIT26,"July 20, 2019",5,Fantabulous!,"What a time warp to the 70s! Thanks Nike for bringing them back. These are comfortable and fun. I would advise that they are quite narrow & elongated. I’m able to wear narrow footwear, but not everyone can. Now all we need is those funky 70s ‘huk-a-poo’ wild print, wide-collar, gender-neutral, button front shirts we all wore with jeans and skirts. Haha. Those were some far-out times!"
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B001PDTO08,R1PN7J096MKO19,"October 8, 2017",4,Snug but stretched,"As others stated, these run a bit small. I measured my foot and using the sizing chart determined I need a size 8, which is my normal size. They were snug in the toe but were not available in an 8.5 for exchange so I decided to keep them. After a few times wearing them they fit much better."
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R1QD1HWBQ763N2,"October 22, 2018",1,Sides bulge out,"After only wearing the shoes for about 4 1/2 hours at work,  The side of the shoes (both shoes, inner side) started bulging out...  And it was not initially like this when I put them on this morning..."
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R34J08TDJMZ2LQ,"September 12, 2018",5,Comfortable as .........!!! Buy Buy!!,Dont even think about it! If you walk alot and cant afford the most comfortable sneaker (adidas ultraboost) get these!!!!!!!!!!!! So similar!
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R1IT6OCNXBR8Z9,"December 15, 2017",5,Perfect nursing sneakers!,"I typically wear a 7-7.5, but I think all Nike’s run a little large so I bought the 7 and they fit perfect! I wear them for long nursing shifts and I can’t say a negative thing about these sneakers. Very comfortable. The “mesh” fabric has some sort of waterproofing on them that makes them very resilient. I absolutely would buy again!"
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R2UZKKG0JAXNCZ,"March 11, 2018",5,Perfect,I buy a new pair of these every year. I run 200+ miles every year on these sneakers and they hold up well and are so comfortable. I always buy 1/2 size bigger in running sneakers. I am normally an 8 and bought an 8 1/2. They fit perfect.
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R23WD7NYK7RYS9,"June 9, 2019",4,"Good, but as one reviewer showed they do bend in at Nike sign","So, ordered them. They came fast and look good color wise. I put them on for like 5 minutes and felt so good I ordered a second pair for this price Nike’s was really good deal. I do have to say as one reviewer showed the giving or bending I noticed it too. It was a few hours in walking outside I looked down and saw right at the front of the Nike sign they gave way or creased or bent outward, what every you want to say. It didn’t make the shoe feel uncomfortable, but I started to wonder about support. I did a mile and a half in them today and they did fine. Not they best I have worn, but not worse either. They do take a little to get use too. First 5 minutes day them came no problem, next day took a little to get use to how they feel when you walk in them. I would not pay full Nike price for them, but I got them discount and for that price good shoe so far."
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,RBD6IYKD3BPA6,"May 16, 2019",5,These are perfect as a lightweight dance shoe!,"These are so lightweight and comfortable for dance!  I use them for Latin-inspired fitness dance and POUND class. I love how it's so easy for me to dance on my toes and actually feel lighter on my feet.  They are also a good pair of ""go to"" shoes for wearing with jeans, etc. and the all black minimal style is great.  I would agree with some that they might not be the best for long walks or hours of standing since there is very little arch support.  If they go on sale again, I will buy another pair."
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R1ZMRK4RLAG2O8,"January 14, 2018",5,Very pleased. I cannot wear arches in my shoes,"Very pleased. I cannot wear arches in my shoes. These don't have a strong arch, but they are still supportive."
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R1URW3E829JLF7,"February 5, 2018",5,Truly wide enough for pregnancy swelling!,Bought these for myself as my feet are finally starting to swell (at 33 weeks pregnant). As a floor nurse I needed to find something comfortable and light weight for my swelling feet and 12 hour shifts. These have been perfect!
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,RLGKCPS6GN0MH,"August 28, 2019",1,These are NOT running shoes,"I bought these sneakers to be my summer running shoes. I have a solid pair of La Sportiva sneakers that I use for winter/trail running, but I was in need of lightweight pair for warmer months. Honestly, I was persuaded to purchase these by a mix of great price and great reviews. I was running about 20 miles/week at the time and feeling good. A month-and-a-half after switching to these sneakers, I was taken down with severe hip bursitis during a race and I was unable to run for two months! I spent the summer in PT and I'm still dealing with residual hip flexor pain, but at least I can run again. I did A LOT more research about sneakers and bought a pair of Saucony Ride ISO for hip support. I love my Sauconys and they weren't that much more expensive then these Nikes. If you are just in need of an inexpensive sneakers that look good to wear while you do weekend errands, these Nikes are probably fine. BUT I strongly suggest you do NOT buy these as actual running shoes. Your hips will thank you!"
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R3C34BXEUKUEFU,"July 10, 2018",5,Very Comfortable Nike Sneakers,"Very nice looking and comfortable Nike sneakers.  I have worn them several times for long walks and biking, and they feel great on my feet.  I truly appreciate the wonderful wonderful customer service, and quick delivery as well.  Thank You So Much."

Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R3VEM4MRDRMY62,"June 24, 2019",5,Nice tennis shoes,"I have high arches so I took out the existing arch pad and put in some from the grocery store that were better and more support and that made them fit better and supportive. Otherwise, the length fits fine and ferl great. I am not a runner though and use them for regular walking . But due to Colin K.  Telling Nike that they should not sell the Betsy Ross Nike tennis shoe due to offensive symbolism ,  this will be my last pair of Nikes."
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R36N5E3AYOF1MJ,"June 15, 2019",5,Comfortable and nice-looking shoes,"The shoes are very comfortable. I always order a half size larger than what I normally wear with any tennis shoes. I can’t stand for my toes to touch any part of the end of the shoe when I’m walking. Plus I wear orthotics, and they fit in the shoe perfectly.  I wear these shoes when I go for walks as well as going out at night wearing my black jeans. The shoes look nice."
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R3TSQN7SRSXVI6,"August 16, 2019",5,Love the blue color,"Love these! They feel a little snug, but usually with all my Nike shoes I have to break them in before I can slip into them easily. Can’t wait to start working out in them!"
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R1HXGP46R6C45G,"August 31, 2019",3,FYI - Caused Blisters but SUPER cute,"I’m a 9.5 or 10 and I got the 9.5 in this shoe.  Super cute!!  My only complaint so far after working out 3 times is that I got the WORST blisters on the back of my feet.  I had to take them off and walk the rest of the way home because it burned so bad.  Now I have to figure out how to get the blood stains out of my new white shoes.  I haven’t had this issue with other shoes but these seem to hit just above where my socks cover and they rub with every step on the back of my ankle.  I did notice the “bulging” issue on the sides of the shoes as other reviewers mentioned, but so far this hasn’t been an issue with how they fit around the foot."
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R18E9AKOM7T53R,"February 27, 2019",5,2nd time buying...,I love these shoes. I’m a nurse and I wear them at work. The are breathable and light weight. Great support!! I walk a lot so I go through shoes fast. This is my second pair.
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R3LMWBITCJSAOK,"October 10, 2018",1,Fake,Did not receive a real Nike Shoe
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R1MUNBAW2US3F3,"September 1, 2019",2,Insoles aren't great.,"I was disappointed to receive these shoes and find one of the insoles not properly adhered in the shoe. It was bent and didn't reach the top of the shoe. Had to unlace the whole shoe, peel the insole and reapply it. Then when I put the shoe on, the inner exterior side of the shoe was warped like it was a worn shoe. The shoe itself fits well. The insoles aren't that comfortable because they seem smaller than the shoe itself, but overall for the price, they will do."
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R256FP2LV10H0U,"March 8, 2019",3,"Color isn’t right, but great fit","The shoes fit great- I’m usually a size 8 and ordered an 8. However, the color was definitely not what I expected. I ordered Gun smoke/ocean bliss/dark gray, and was expecting the ocean bliss to be a nice blue color, like in the picture, but instead it’s a bright, fluorescent yellow-green color (see pic). Definitely not what I wanted and not my style, but I’ll have to end up keeping them because I’m too busy to return at this point, hence why I ordered shoes online."
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Running Shoe,B06XK9L1NR,R1DXLF1X378H5W,"August 13, 2018",5,Comfortable at a good price,These shoes are very comfortable.  I took the advice of some reviewers and purchased a half size larger.  These shoes are very comfortable and worth the price.
Nike,Women's Benassi Just Do It Sandal,B073C5GY8G,R34YG4SKKUY3BF,"June 20, 2017",5,Love it!,Love it! Fits like a glove I'm usually a size 6-6.5 depending on shoe. I ordered 6 and it fits perfectly t! Also very comfortable :)
Nike,Women's Benassi Just Do It Sandal,B073C5GY8G,RP7M1GENDA8UC,"July 23, 2018",1,Very disapointed.,"I ordered these because I went to a Nike outlet that carried flip flops just like these and they were SO unbelievably comfortable. I didn't purchase them at the store, so i figured I'd look through amazon to find them. These appeared to be the same flip flops but I was super unhappy when I received these in the mail. The strap over the top of the foot is nonadjustable and extremely tight. I had my mom who is 2 shoe sizes smaller than me try them on and the strap was even to tight for her feet. The soles were extremely hard and stiff and they were very uncomfortable. I sent these back right away and I do not recommend these to anyone looking for comfort."
Nike,Women's Benassi Just Do It Sandal,B073C5GY8G,R1BBRXNMK0HPJR,"April 15, 2018",5,I returned them and bought a size 9 and they are perfect and extremely comfortable,"Okay so, I read reviews on this . I wear a size 8 1/2 in USA . I originally ordered a size 8 because of some of the reviews. It was literally cutting off circulation in my toes so, I returned them and bought a size 9 and they are perfect and extremely comfortable!  Yes to the buy!"
Nike,Women's Benassi Just Do It Sandal,B073C5GY8G,R2VWXDD5N9ROK1,"June 7, 2017",5,Five Stars,Love these! The bright color was just what I was looking for! Super comfy and fit perfect!
Nike,Women's Benassi Just Do It Sandal,B073C5GY8G,R7MKQVN5CCR7W,"September 19, 2018",5,Comfy/ Cute Slides for around the house and quick trips around town,"I love these! They are extremely cute and pretty comfortable, especially for the price. The cushion under the band feels amazing and the bottom is firm and supportive. The cusion under the strap means they won’t make for the best pool slide or shower shoe. From a durability standpoint, don’t expect to wear them for full days out on the town. I purchased as a cute shoe to wear around the house and maybe grab a pedicure and they are perfect for that. If your looking for a comfortable everyday walking sandal, you’ll probably need to pony up some extra cash. However, if your looking for a casual slide to run quick errands and wear around the house, these will be great for you."
Nike,Women's Benassi Just Do It Sandal,B073C5GY8G,R1VNXU31RXUGQ6,"May 12, 2017",5,Great fit,I was afraid it would not fit because of my wide width foot but it did. I normally wear size 8 I bought that size it was perfect makes my feet look neat not to mention it is an original. Great buy
Nike,Women's Benassi Just Do It Sandal,B073C5GY8G,R1ER1S05BG221D,"May 9, 2017",4,Needed for the gym,"I wear an 8 1/2 and ordered a 9 because they don't have Velcro to adjust the way my old shoes did.  On one hand, that's good because I am replacing my old ones because the Velcro is pulling off, on the other, you can't adjust it.  If it had the ability to adjust, I would have gone with the 8.  I find these are a bit large, which is better than being too small."
Nike,Women's Benassi Just Do It Sandal,B073C5GY8G,R2G7EIRUUHKGOK,"July 10, 2019",5,SO COMFORTABLE,"I used to HATE the look of slides, never really owned a pair. I borrowed a pair from a friend once and liked them enough to give them a shot, so I got these. I LOVE THESE SLIDES. They are so comfortable; the top is padded and doesn't give you that friction burn on the top of the foot as some others do.  The material feels like great quality; I can tell they're going to last me a while. They are snug enough to stay on, but stretchy enough to wear them with socks. They are perfect for running in and out, sitting by the pool, taking the dog out on a walk, etc. The colors look just like the picture. I got the black with the rose gold logo and I'm in the process of choosing a second pair. You won't regret this purchase!"

I've had originals Nike before and after enquiring and comparing, these are NOT original Nike! Due to the hard rubbery material, they are not comfortable at all, actually hurt my heels.

When you walk, they trip you all the time. Pls pls don’t buy them here. I’m telling you. Just go to NIKE website to get a pair. Then you wouldn’t be like me to be fooled. If I could, I would give a zero star."

Most of the time, I already have my thick work socks on since I have to change into work boots, but lately, I've been slipping into these for leisure time. Very comfortable."
Nike,Women's Benassi Just Do It Sandal,B073C5GY8G,R2WMN8H2I0G2QI,"August 4, 2017",5,The best slides!,I'm absulotely in love with these slides. The only slides I will buy are from Nike because they are strong good quality and last me a long time. The price is affordable and good. I will definitely buy again! It did for a little larger but you can barely tell. I would definitely order your size or maybe a half of a size smaller.
Nike,Women's Benassi Just Do It Sandal,B073C5GY8G,R12NQ2XRJ9WWSK,"November 6, 2019",5,Comfortable,"This is my first pair of slides. I had wanted a pair for a while for casual use. They’re great for wearing after I’ve been stuck in uncomfortable shoes for awhile. I’ll keep them handy in my car if I know I’ll be out and about. After walking around an amusement park all day, standing out in the rain (with my feet eventually getting soaked), and walking in 3 inch heels to a formal event, the slides were a very comfortable and welcoming change when I would get back to my car. I also wear them around the house regularly like slippers. Side note... I injured my heel several months ago. These have been good for shock absorbency and keeping me out of pain."

Would recomend , but my white ones are a 7 ,i usually take 7.5 in anything nike , and the 7 fit like a 7.5 perfectly , then i got the black in a 7 and they are alittle smaller wich still fit but like a 7"
Nike,Women's Benassi Just Do It Sandal,B073C5GY8G,R3UFXOV6CW2AF8,"May 6, 2017",4,Love love love,Came early I will be ordering again these are everything true to size im glad I got a 10 they are narrow I have to say but they are so comfortable I have the all white ones  I gave a 4 star cause I don't know how stretched out they will become after a while I have fat wide feet sooooooo

To wear around the house to help with my heel pain. I really didn’t think they would help. But I was surprised because they really do help with my heel pain. So these are my new go to house shoes
Nike,Women's Benassi Just Do It Sandal,B073C5GY8G,R3ADCWVE43VVTK,"July 14, 2019",2,Get one size larger if you buy at all,"The top is way too tight. I normally wear an 8 but this feels more like a 7. I bought these shoes because I cannot wear anything between my toes due to arthritis. Unfortunately the incredibly tight band rests on my arthritic toe joints and they are completely unadjustable. The only reason I'm not returning them is because I plan to wear them only to walk out on my deck when it's too hot to go barefoot. In other words, I will only be wearing them for 10-30 seconds at a time. I would NEVER be able to wear them outside the house; they're uncomfortable. They cost $25 but I guarantee they cost no more than $1 or $2  to manufacture and maybe another 20 cents for shipping and handling. Just another rip off of American women."
Nike,Women's Benassi Just Do It Sandal,B073C5GY8G,R5V7PCQYHEZ7O,"June 14, 2019",1,Very disappointed,"I was so excited to receive these after so many great reviews I read. And they ended up being the worst slide sandals I’ve ever owned & that includes the ones I’ve purchased at Walmart. They run a little small & tight which makes them less comfy. Instead of finding them comfortable at all, they’re actually painful to wear because the front edge of the strap across the top digs into my big toes. And the base of the shoe is very hard & rigid. Definitely regret this purchase!"

My god, i have not had a more painful walk in my life. The entire point of these is that they are MORE comfortable than other shoes. And the previous versions were! Not these! If i wanted my feet torn up I'd just go walk barefoot outside. Not sure why i paid $130 bucks for shoes that tear the skin from my feet more than the pavement would. The sides are hard, not soft like the older versions. But they're also thinner. There is some kind of sealant over the fabric that hardens it to the point you might as well be wearing plastic shoes. Incredibly disappointed in this purchase. I'm not sure how i feel about these. I have an older pair of Nike flyknit shoes that i loved, but they started to tear. I bought these newer versions and they're far more stiff and tight, difficult to get on, and not nearly as comfortable. Maybe they just need to be broken in, But my last pair didn't start off like this."

We bought three pair and have continued to buy every year. They are so amazing I do not know how so much stability and comfort can be in the bottom of one, lightweight adorable shoe!  Loooove this pair!  They are the cutest. Funny thing though - they seem to squeak a bit at times. Hope that fades as they’re broken in. Beyond worth it though. I love them!!"
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,R3W3HP8UPSKPC9,"June 20, 2019",5,Great lightweight running shoes!,"I had to order a new pair of these because my old pair from 4 years ago is finally starting to wear out for workouts but is still good for day to day wear. I love how lightweight these shoes are - they are perfect for packing on trips if you plan on trying to get some gym time or running in. I even brought them with me to Maui twice and used them for morning walks and light hiking. I have noticed that my old pair doesn't come up as far on my upper foot/ankle as the new pair, which I preferred for some extra breathability, but other than that, I haven't noticed any major differences. These were purchased as part of my ""time to lose the extra baby weight"" project. Some new workout gear is great for motivation to get out and jog while pushing the stroller around. And the breathability of the Flyknit shoes is great for summer fitness outside. Just glad I could find them, as a search through Nike's website brought up no results."
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,R2IYB7LPUPZ3G7,"May 17, 2018",5,Light- weight and super comfortable,"Excellent shoe. I love that it’s knit - it weighs next to nothing and the air circulates through the shoes so your feet don’t sweat. I have them in two colors now, black and white, and love both. The fit it, to me, on the larger side. I’m normally a 9.5 but in these the 9 is perfect. I do have narrow feet though, so that may be part of the reason the smaller size fits."
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,R3SQ3J91QBYJH,"April 7, 2019",5,Wearing my dream sneakers!,"I have fallen in love with these shoes upon trying them on.  I have not run in them yet, but they feel great walking around in them.  Other shoes, when you first put them on, you just know it doesn’t feel right.  They are so snug and fit like a glove.  I did not have to order a different size.  I am not sure about going sock-less in them yet.  That seems wierd to me still.  But they are my favorite sneakers so far and you can wear socks in them.  They look so nice on my feet.  I love the color."
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,R319BB3I3BMHVO,"November 10, 2018",1,Read before buying.,These shoes are gently used. Mine came with slightly dirty soles and little scuffs on the front toe. They also fit small when I tried them on elseware and they fit fine. Was disappointed and if I hadn’t thrown out the box already I’d return them.
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,ROU8JI1SXG5B6,"June 30, 2019",5,One word - LOVE,"These shoes fit perfectly, and they look and feel like the high quality you would expect from Nike. My last 5 pair of shoes have been Under Armour. Wasn’t getting the support my feet needed from their shoes lately so decided to go back to Nike. So glad I did. This shoe is very comfortable, lightweight, gorgeous and made to last with high quality material. I wear a size 8 and have narrow feet. I didn’t size down, the 8 is just right. Also, on my hardwood floors the traction and grip is just fine - no sliding around whatsoever. With or without socks these shoes are Amazing!! :-)"
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,RBPXMVBV5L4JK,"August 4, 2019",1,"This is a seller review, not the product review","I absolutely love the shoes. They are my go to gym shoes. I have 4 pairs and these were my 5th. They give me plenty of arch support and cushion when I run or am doing HIIT. I do go down 1/2 size in these than I do in my other Nike Free Run’s. Here is the bad: I thought I was getting the all over Crimson (Orange/Coral) color which is what I ordered and it was the picture that showed solid Crimson color. However, what I received was the Crimson/Silver. Which is mainly silver shoe with a bit of orange/coral color. I kept the shoes because I do love them and I paid under $65 for them, but you, the seller, should not advertise one color and send another even though you are also adventuring the Crimson/Silver color as well."

They’re oddly stiff and make a terrible squeaky noise when I walk now (took about 1 month to develop). It’s as if they got wet, but they’ve never been in the rain... will never buy Nike shoes from Amazon again. Are these knockoffs??"
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,RHNJZ0CKWELGH,"August 3, 2018",5,"Great shoe, Great Price!","These shoes are great. I have owned the Nike Free RN Flynit 2017 and I thought they were fantastic. I upgraded because I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed! These shoes are great for running, they are lightweight and fit comfortably on your feet. They also have a very modest look to them, allowing for not only wearing them for working out, but for business casual occasions as well. My only issue with the shoe is the shoe laces. Apart from everything, the shoe laces become this shoes downfall, sometimes I tie my shoe and then not 5 min later I'm bending over again to tie them. The laces are made out of some pretty slick material, I wish they used the laces from last years model. Other than that, It's a great shoe for a great price!"
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,R6Y5CJRI8PKA7,"January 3, 2019",5,Great buy,These are lightweight and comfortable. I'm going to get another pair in a different colour.

I tried them on at a sports store before I purchased them from Amazon so I already knew what size to get!  My shoe size is between a 9 and a 9 1/2 and the size 9 fit just right.  I had surgery on my foot so I have been having a hard time finding shoes that didn't make my foot ache and these are perfect."

They feel so good on my feet and I don’t have to wear socks with them.
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,R2HEFLW9A7W95R,"November 26, 2019",5,Favorite running shoes,These are my favorite.  I wear them for my Orangetheory workouts.  They are difficult to find as I think the style may have changed.  I wear a  size 8 in regular shoes and I get a 9 in my workout shoes which are perfect.  I feel that Nike shoes run a little short.
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,R22G6GVNJD90E0,"August 9, 2019",1,Shoe is a cheap knock off.,"This shoe is a knock off. The fabric is stiff and the sole is as hard as a rock. Definitely not the quality of the flyknits I have been wearing for the past few years. Not to mention, in the image, the Nike swoosh is white, and on the shoe I received it is black."
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,R245YB886DOIGJ,"July 23, 2019",3,Disappointing,Not as good as the 2017 model. Would not recommend buying these if you’re looking for something similar to the 2017 model. The fit for these shoes I found to be comparatively tighter at the Achilles area and the great toe. Disappointing.
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,RS7R3GAJUS4WR,"July 31, 2019",1,Toebox material not as comfy as 2017 version,I have a 2017 version of this shoe which I absolutely fell in love with.  Thought I'd take a chance and purchase a 2018 version online (something I never do because I always have to try on my shoes).  I was sitting when I put it on and everything felt fine...until I stood up and started to walk around.  There was a hard material at the front of the shoe that really aggravated my toes.  The 2017 didn't seem to have this which made it super comfy.  I had to return it.  Very disappointed.
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,R2DYCTLJK2QMAP,"July 26, 2019",5,"One description, not always same style but still love them.","Love the shoe however the description “free run flyknit” is being used to describe two different Nike shoes. I own about 15 pair, not bragging, just saying I more than know the difference. This is my all time favorite shoe they carry. The toe area is not all soft knit on this black one or white one however, the colors are. My preference is the all soft knit throughout but still like these enough to keep them."
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,R1QOAHUA5632GD,"July 26, 2019",5,Terrific!,"These shoes are terrific. I just wore them two days at Disneyland and they were lightweight, not too hot and they look fly. I have a wide foot and they are great because they stretch so I imagine they’d work for just about everyone. The laces are pretty much decorative, the shoe is a bit like a stretchy slip on.  Love them!"
Nike,Womens Free RN Flyknit 2018 Running Athletic,B078Y9GNQF,R292OYRWONABC9,"December 15, 2018",3,Color varies,"Love these shoes. Was not pleased with the color, it arrived a little brighter and plasticity looking than the picture. The shoes are incredibly comfortable but the color looked cheap to me"
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B075ZYK9GD,RGNU9MAI2EAPV,"June 26, 2019",5,Great for Walking and running around for hours,"I am a dog walker so I’m on my feet throughout the day.  My last pair of sneakers were in the flex “family” and I took a chance on this pair, usually I prefer to get shoes in the store.  The first day or so my feet had to adjust, but after that they’ve been ideal (except on rainy days with the mesh top).  I’ve been using them for months now and am still incredibly happy with them!"
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B075ZYK9GD,R2PKJ1SUEDC6W2,"June 29, 2019",5,FAVORITE Running Shoes,"Nike Flex RN are my absolute favorite running shoes. I typically run 3-5 miles a day, and they are light, flexible, and never uncomfortable. I have tried other much more expensive running shoes, which hurt my knees when I run. (Too stiff for my gait?) I have both 2017 and 2018 Flex and love both. I will never run in anything else."
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B075ZYK9GD,R2W943SBI5ZS4N,"August 31, 2019",4,Not bad...,"I have mixed reviews on this shoe. Normally wear a size 6 but it was tight. Very similar to the Nike Free RN. Returned and bought 6.5 which is better, however it’s pretty wide so I tightened my laces as much as possible. Not the greatest fit but better than the 6 especially when your foot expands from exercising or running. Shoes are very comfortable though. Haven’t been impressed with Nikes shoe designs lately. I never buy plain black and white shoes but these were the best looking ones I’ve seen up to date."

They are extremely light...like walking/running on air.  They fit perfectly right out of the box...no need to break them in.  Great variety of colors.  I practically live in these shoes.  I have a pair for the gym, a pair for shopping, a pair for lawn work, and plenty stockpiled for when they are no longer available.  In fact, I ordered a pair of the men's for my son.  Love, love, love these shoes."

They are the most comfortable Nike’s I’ve ever bought! I have worn an 8 in some Nike running shoes and 8.5 in others. The 8.5 was perfect in these! They look really good, and I’m sure that I will be able to run faster and jump higher! LOL! Also.. you can’t beat the price for these! I’ve spent way more on shoes for my kids. These are a great deal!"
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B075ZYK9GD,R1MS7XOZGZXVG2,"May 27, 2019",5,Good arch support,"I was hesitant to buy these shoes because I read that they ran a size small, but this information is inaccurate; they seem to fit as any other Nike 8. I admit when I first put them on, I thought they might be a bit smaller than other Nike 8s, but when you tie the laces and your foot moves into the arch support system of the shoe, the fit is as expected. The shoes give good support for running on the street (of course at 56 yrs, I always look for a little more).  :) with the shoes"
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B075ZYK9GD,R3W2J9NIAZPUMT,"June 21, 2019",5,Feel amazing,"My new favorite sneaker. I’m overweight and needed something I could workout in (walk) that wouldn’t cause knee, ankle or back pain. This is definitely a great purchase and I have two other pairs now in different colors. I switch them out so I never have to wear the same pair back to back. They last longer that way and your shoes really need time between use. Will definitely purchase again in a few more months."

I have fairly narrow feet, but I have bunions, so my shoes need to accommodate my narrow heel and have a wider toe box. I also look for a shoe with a straighter last and one that I can put orthotics in without raising my heel so high that the shoe slips in the heel. Well, this shoe is perfect for me! The fabric structure of the shoe accommodates my bunions, too. The first pair I purchased locally at the retail price. They have lasted well, but since my feet are difficult to fit, I started looking for a back up...I couldn’t find anything that fit as well. Then I began looking for the same style I had been wearing...this shoe. I found it here at Amazon! Well, the very best price was for the peachy , pinky colored ones. They are shown in the ad as Hilfiger sandals:0, but I figured if I was sent the sandals I could send them back. However, they are great and are just like my original purchase. I am planning to order another pair today because the price has dropped from low price I paid just last week! Lucky me!"

These are the most perfectly sized and comfortable tennis shoes I have worn in a long time. Others always give me problems in the toe area where it is too tight and make walking uncomfortable. I ordered a size 9 and was worried whether I should size up to a 9.5. Well it fit perfect. So happy with these shoes. Comfofor walking /and I walk a lot! And very pretty!

Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B075ZYK9GD,R240WEL5SP4SF6,"September 2, 2019",3,"Comfortable, but...","I love these shoes.. for the most part. The arches are supportive, the shoes are flexible and breathable, making them very comfortable normally. But, I walk on a lot of different trails for exercise. For paved surfaces, these are great! But, for gravel or natural trails, things constantly get stuck in the crevices of the bottoms. It causes discomfort while walking when this happens. I end up having to stop to get rocks out of my shoes every 10 minutes or less.  And then it's such a pain to have to take tweezers to these every night, getting rocks and debris out of the slits in them. So if you're wearing these indoors or to walk on paved surfaces they're a great choice, but otherwise stay away!"

This is by far the worst pair of shoes ive ever owned. The color is supposed to be black/dark grey, but it looks more like a hunter green in the light. I ordered a size 9 as I do in all shoes(really need an 8 1\2 but I always order up). I literally had to use both hands to get this shoe on my foot. Needless to say ill be returning these today"
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B075ZYK9GD,R1NTMYT5O1TC38,"January 1, 2020",4,Comfortable and Lightweight,These are great. They have nice support for the arch of your foot. They’re lightweight and very good for walking and running. I workout between 3-4 days a week and I’m hoping these sneakers will withstand the use. I gave them 4 stars because I haven’t had them long enough to know if they will last with that kind of use although I’m sure they will.
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B075ZYK9GD,R1GJQ3XH4NS7Z9,"March 28, 2019",1,Not what I was looking for at all.,These shoes have ZERO support.  The soles are far to squishy and too soft to prevent any pronation or supination. much like walking on a soft pillow. I was looking for a supportive running shoe to use and these are NOT it.  Only bonus is they are very lightweight.
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B075ZYK9GD,R3GMQ46JDCVKY7,"June 8, 2019",1,Loved the color but...,"I thought I would shop for new work sneakers.  I usually wear a 7 1/2 but I when I received this order and opened up the box to try them on...well let's just say I questioned whether or not they were a 7 1/2 and not a definite size 6.  Idk, too small so I returned them.  With Nike's I think I am better off trying them in the store as oppose to ordering them online.  But that's just me...."

Since then I’ve been trying out different brands, like New Balance, and after comparing the two the NB’s seem more comfortable to me. These shoes are stylish and sleek, but after wearing them for long periods of time they start to feel constricting."

After a lot of browsing and review reading, she found these bad boys and ordered them. She absolutely loves them! Wore them to break in as soon as she received them, they were spot on her size super comfortable and has thick sole and therefore great for a running shoes!

They were much lighter than expected but very supportive. I thought the light weight was a bad sign but no. These shoes were excellent from day one. No blisters and no break in period. I have bunions and they weren't an issue (7.5 m). I run 2 miles/day 6days/week. It's been two weeks and my knees feel great. I'm 53 and I'll be getting these for years to come.

And it’s all I wear. I work at a nursing home. An my feet all the time. They r very comfortable. And light. I’m on the heavier side. And let me tell ya. These shoes are the balm.  I own a pair before had them for a yr and still holding up. Decided to order another pair. Was glad to find them on here. Just and FYI, they run on the 1/2 size smaller side. I usually wear a size 7 1/2 in shoes. In this brand I had to get a size 8 medium. These r all I get now. They have a great arch support. Also helps on my knees and hips."

The support is good and they are super comfortable. I had some other shoes that had a high arch thing inside jabbing my inner foot and these are not like that at all—nice and even inside.
Nike,Women's Run Swift Sneaker,B07144JK28,R3DO0CV5KBHNUZ,"January 23, 2020",5,Great Shoe!,I normally wear a 10.5 in Nike and ordered a 10.5. The shoes fit great! They are very comfortable and seem durable. I really like the look of them and they have been excellent for running so far. I would recommend them to someone looking for a stylish athletic shoe that will go with everything and provide comfort during running/walking/gym activities.
Nike,Women's Run Swift Sneaker,B07144JK28,R3UGBVMZ01OVP,"February 3, 2020",5,Fits my narrow heel,I am so pleased with these shoes.  It is a perfect fit for me.  I have a narrow heel and high instep.  I think they are going to wear great.  They are not as cushioned as some of my sneakers but right now they feel great.  This is my first pair of Nikes so I’m not sure what to expect.

Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,R2Y19WJHNWFPOC,"September 1, 2019",3,Not durable,The shoe is comfortable but it can only handle low impact. I bought these shoes back in April and they are already tearing and falling apart. I don’t use them often. I use them indoors for weight training maybe twice a week and I might take them on a walk once a week on a flat sidewalk. There is a tear in each shoe in the same location. Seems poorly built. Definitely won’t be buying Nike the next time I need a workout shoe. Overpriced and just not made how they used to be. I bought a pair of adidas and converse around the same time and they are still going strong. I use them more frequently too.
Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,R3HNND7VJ0ZUM3,"April 11, 2019",5,Love these shoes!,"They are comfy and great for cardio and weight training.  When I tried them on in the store, the size 8 was too big, so I ordered an 7.5 online since the store did not have them.  The 7.5 is a little snug and hits my toes sometimes.  I guess I should have gone with the 8.  I like how they wrap around your foot for additional support too."
Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,R1CN24HT2MVJZO,"August 6, 2019",5,Best work out shoes,BEST exercise shoe I have tried on and own. I own two pairs of ASICS (different types) and have tried different shoes on multiple times. These are supportive of my moderate-high arches. They even keep my ankles from hurting after a work out. So comfortable and they look pretty good too. I'm almost tempted to wear them all the time.
Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,R18ACJWZKQHV85,"March 23, 2019",4,A wider version of Nike,I haven’t worn Nike’s in years as they tend to be too tight. These were exactly what I was looking for (true trainer rather than running shoe). Light weight material great. I wonder if a half-size smaller would be better once they stretch a bit.
Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,R27KVH99EG5T78,"March 27, 2019",2,Showed up with security tag on them,"Well, these are the shoes I wanted for my trip in a couple of days, but they showed up with a security tag on them, that can only be removed with a special device. Don’t even know what to do at this point, but I’m not happy. Im going to try to go to a store and hope they don’t think I stole them."
Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,R2VF8BQCRKJ70B,"September 1, 2018",5,She likes,She lost the last one running from wolves so this one will replace that one  thx !
Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,R3P9F3SJVDU8B7,"March 28, 2019",4,You might not get the color you ordered,My only problem with this shoe is there's  2 colors of burgundy with the same shoe number. One is lighter and one is darker looks almost black well I got the darker  one. I wanted the lighter but with only one left in stock I wasn't sure I would even get the one I wanted so I just kept the darker ones. They couldn't guarente that one pair would still be available if I tried to exchange. They are very comfortable.
Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,R1CNKYBRRHH0QD,"June 18, 2019",5,Nice low impact,"I have extremely high arches and these will do just fine for low impact workouts, like the elliptical.  I find when I’m lifting weights that the shoes seem to lack support, but I like how lightweight they are."
Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,RJR7ZCAMBKRPG,"July 21, 2019",5,Comfortable shoe!,I wore these shoes for the first time for a bout 10 hours on my feet the entire rime with no issues at all.  Great support and cushioning!  I usually wear a 9.5M and ordered these in that size with a perfect fit.
Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,R2O3H6HX0H6Y4T,"December 31, 2019",2,Lack of support,"I typically love Nike cross trainers. For whatever reason, these do not have enough support for me when I work out. My feet even hurt after wearing these as everyday shoes. I’ve gone back to wearing a pair I bought about 3 years ago."
Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,R2SZZBCUTOA4PY,"September 5, 2019",1,Hole in botto,I’ve had these shoes one month and LOVED them!! Super comfortable and fit my custom inserts for my arches! HOWEVER after do a few workout the bottoms are falling apart. There is literally a hold in my shoe from running/misc HIT workouts. I’d love my money back...

Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,RPMOBCOZ83A10,"July 17, 2019",5,Perfect gym trainers,Everything
Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,R89AVY3ETDNEY,"February 1, 2020",1,Unsatisfied,I buy all my Nikes the same size. For some reason these fit me bigger than the other ones. I needed new gym sneakers so bad that I threw the last pair out and had no choice but to wear these when I got them. The price on the box was also $10 less than what they sold them to me for. Never again!!!
Nike,Women's in-Season TR 8 Cross Training Shoes,B078B2GSFR,R3PYCSO8BEN3TJ,"August 22, 2019",5,Comfortable with good support,These shoes have a cushioned bottom and are deep enough to put in a heel wedge.

Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Running Shoe,B07H98Z61R,RALO69CRT55QK,"July 4, 2019",4,Love my Nike shoes,I have plantar fasciitis and need to wear shoes with good arch support. I LOVE my Nike shoes. They are light in weight and the insoles are the most important part.

Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Running Shoe,B07H98Z61R,R2BS639FAM1MCJ,"January 12, 2020",5,Nike is the best!,"For folks with hard to fit feet or walkers/runners that need the most comfort in a shoe, this is it.  I always come back to Nike.  This shoe is like walking on marshmallows! Air Zoom would be the best shoe for everyone, perhaps even elite runners.  I tried to use a cheaper shoe but I just wasted my money.  This is the shoe you want."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Running Shoe,B07H98Z61R,R1I1P58X0ZXAI0,"October 11, 2019",5,Shoes are Great !,"I bought these shoes because I loved the color. ( it is a very bright pink ).  Having never tried them on, I wasn’t sure if they’d be comfortable. I bought a half size smaller than I normally wear. (81/2 instead of a 9) They are absolutely PERFECT and so comfortable. Im on my feet a lot and these shoes are great. Highly recommend !"
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Running Shoe,B07H98Z61R,R20MNWQBN2RUFT,"December 27, 2019",4,Fits like Pegasus 35,They made a few changes since my Pegasus 35's. I bought both in the black/white/grey. I like the grey in the 35's as you can definitely tell the difference between that grey and the black.  Not so much on the 36's. Also I liked the tongue sewn in place better (which I originally thought I wouldn't like). I know both are minor and of course don't affect the fit. I only gave 4 stars because I don't get or care for the advertising on the outside of the shoe and on the tongue. The fit is very comfortable even though my foot is a little on the wide side.
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Running Shoe,B07H98Z61R,R2MBPZWSRCN32F,"September 20, 2019",5,Super running shoes,Great shoe for runners second pair I’ve bought for my daughter
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Running Shoe,B07H98Z61R,R1Z0270981MTQU,"January 26, 2020",3,"Easy On the Eyes, Not on the Heel","I’ve been wearing the Pegasus series for years and they have fit perfectly.  I walk, run and kick around in these shoes.  This latest in the Pegasus line is good looking but less functional.  The overall fit is good except the back top (heel/ankle).  It’s as if the shoe gets relaxed there and leaves enough of a gap to allow heel to move hence rub. I tighten the laces and it still happens.  Will be investing in different shoes for an upcoming 7K.  These will be for short, walking outings around town."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Running Shoe,B07H98Z61R,R5Y7NF2S8XEPK,"February 2, 2020",5,Great for running!,"These shoes are quite good for runners! I hover around 30 miles per week and run mostly on concrete. These shoes are not too narrow which is sometimes a concern. They fit as expected (I got a woman's 7) and are very comfortable. The colors are exactly as shown in the picture. I prefer the Nike Pegasus Zoom 35, (this is the updated version), but this version is still a great shoe."

Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Running Shoe,B07H98Z61R,R32XIPKAI1PNJ3,"February 12, 2020",1,Product was not new as noted in details,These shoes were used not new and they smelled faintly of vinegar or sweaty feet. They had dirt on the heels and marks on the outside as well. The white cushion at the bottom around the shoe had several creases showing that it was used for more than just trying on. The bottom of the shoes also smelled like flowery hand soap which says to me the bottom of the shoe was washed.

Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,R1IGROFXB84CEN,"August 9, 2019",4,Great shoe- small tongue,"These greatly changes my running stamina- love them!  Comfortable for my wide foot and super lightweight.  The shoe tongue, though, is weirdly narrow.  I can’t just slide my feet into these and go.  I have to make sure tongue is properly place, otherwise my socks show."
Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,R19CIDOE2T7Q42,"January 10, 2020",4,Comfortable and nice looking.,"Laces were pulled really tight upon arrival but easily adjusted to improve width.  Don't know what some other reviewers were saying about the tongue - seems like a regular tongue to me.  I'm a treadmiller, not a runner, but they worked well for me with fast walking.  Style is a bit better looking than typical running shoes."
Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,R2IGXM0ONA4K8W,"June 25, 2019",5,"Wife is very happy with these, entry level runner.","Good support and fit, shoes also look very cute/stylish.  Only downside is my wife wishes there was a tad more support in the front of the fit, heel support is perfect."
Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,R3VMXMAEQ2I8QJ,"July 12, 2019",1,Small- shoe tongue doesn't cover laces!,"I have always worn a size 9 in Nike shoes. The shoe is way too small. When I go to lace up my shoes, you can see the socks I am wearing because the tongue doesn't cover the entire opening where the laces are. Do you not buy the shoe! I will be returning them as soon as possible."
Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,R1TMO05X0YSG6Y,"November 14, 2019",2,Same model different color,"I have the same shoe/model in black and love that pair, run in them all the time. For some reason this pair doesn't feel right. Fit a bit smaller. The tongue on the left shoes doesn't cover the whole top of area. You can see my sock right thru it. No fitsole, inside feels hard. Just not a good running shoe at all."
Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,R3QVD6MU06CJBL,"July 6, 2019",4,Good fit,I like the way the shoe fits and it iss a comfortable shoe for me   I wish the pictures had been a little clearer as I dont do sparkles.
Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,R1ID4W4F3H0IEG,"September 22, 2019",5,Comfy,So after reading many reviews I went ahead and I purchased this product and I have to say they are super comfortable especially for long walks I do agree with some of the comments that say the tongue is too short it's just awkward and I don't feel like it's wide enough but it's not like you can tell but other than that no issues
Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,R3HP4P6YXG6PGZ,"December 23, 2019",3,Not worth buying,"These are ok, but they do show your socks cause the tongue is not large enough."
Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,RJ28S2ONWLQBK,"October 5, 2019",5,over seas,"I need a return label. The item is beautiful! it was a gift to my niece over seas. Didn't fit. It was returned to me. Thank you. Please, I do need your consideration on this matter. Thank you."
Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,RID8Q8DHF5NFH,"January 31, 2020",3,Runs small -order half a size larger,"Received on Jan 31, in a used Christmas taped shoe sized box with no markings or shoe size indicated on it. Someone else's shipping label had been partially torn off of it.  So, obviously a returned item."
Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,R2IPM4VBSNE4HY,"December 22, 2019",4,Nice price,My wife loves the color
Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,R3JHQMSXQAXUA2,"January 9, 2020",3,Better prices elsewhere!,The shoes are fine. I did some research after they arrived for the exact same model and size and found out I payed over double what this shoes goes for in store. Shop around!!! I bought the gunsmoke/greenglow model.
Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,R2HCKQR1PL3MMR,"November 20, 2019",1,Mal,"Cancele la devolución por qué es un problema hacerlo, mejor los regale, pero me enviaron otro mídelo otro color y otro número"

Nike,Run Swift Sneaker,B07HCN2QNK,R39JWWJTC1LG9N,"October 7, 2018",5,Light and comfortable!,Perfect width for my mediium/large width feet. So comfortable!
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Wide Sneaker,B075ZYPVR4,R36DNWD3L763BA,"March 12, 2019",4,Very comfortable and provide decent support,"I own a few pairs of this model sneaker.  I wear them to walk about 5 miles a day, play tennis and I wear them casually.  They are good for all those purposes, very comfortable.  I particularly like the decent-sized toe box and the knit (i.e. flexible) material.  They provide good support and enough cushioning to protect me from flare up of shin-splints.  And they look pretty cute.  I will probably buy more."
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Wide Sneaker,B075ZYPVR4,R62A2UQD88O3H,"July 28, 2018",5,Best walking shoe ever~,"I love, love, love these shoes. These are my second pair! I have a bad back and Parkinson's disease, these shoes are perfect! They are light not heavy on the feet and my feet never hurt!!  If you do alot of walking or are on your feet a long time I recommend these shoes! I havd my first pair for 2 years and they still look like new. Excellent quality for a great price in my book."
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Wide Sneaker,B075ZYPVR4,R69Y70XTQWASN,"January 9, 2019",2,"Cute, completely without support","They run a bit small for 9 W.  There was no specific arch support.  The shoe doesn't support the foot at all.  They're cute, they were reasonably comfortable, but a sport shoe they were not.  I returned them."
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Wide Sneaker,B075ZYPVR4,R2AMBRVP29T2UE,"February 10, 2019",5,Excellent shoe second time around!,"This is the second pair of this particular shoe I have used for exercising. They are very comfortable, where well, and fit is perfect. It is great when a product is available again when you are ready for new workout shoes. It takes out the guess work and possibility you may end up with a pair of shoes that sits in your closet!"
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Wide Sneaker,B075ZYPVR4,R28Q9TXI1G412Z,"January 1, 2019",4,"Good, but heel cup seemed brittle",Love these shoes. I ordered a 9.5 wide and they fit great. Slightly upset that the first pair only lasted 4 months of light usage because the plastic cup on the back of the heel broke and poked through the fabric and would tear up the back of my foot. I’m hoping this pair lasts longer.
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Wide Sneaker,B075ZYPVR4,R3HP7W52N5171,"April 10, 2019",5,"Comfort and style, even while exercising. I love these shoes :)","I love these shoes. I did have to break them in, but they are well worth it. They are more narrow than some of my other shoes, which is true to the reviews that I've read about them, but I personally like that, especially for running because my foot doesn't slide in them. However, if you are someone who prefers a little more room, a wide would probably be better. Very comfortable, great product, and arrived right when I expected it to. Thank you!"
Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Wide Sneaker,B075ZYPVR4,R358X28ZDNQUR2,"September 4, 2019",4,Repeat purchase,I like that my special made inserts fit. I hate the I got the wrong size. So I switched with someone who had gotten the wrong size from their order. GO figure. These shoe can be worn all day and the look good.

Nike,Women's Revolution 4 Wide Sneaker,B075ZYPVR4,R1WZPW4EWM5RV2,"September 25, 2018",3,Uncomfortable,The shoe looks as pictured but is very uncomfortable. I bought them to wear at work and after just a few hours my feet are killing me. Currently looking for a comfortable sole insert that might make my feet feel better.

Nike,Women's Downshifter 9 Sneaker,B07H84HP4K,R2LD14Y06K2CJN,"May 14, 2019",5,Great service and product,The shoes were perfect very comfortable and nice looking. The shoes came right on time and in excellent condition.
Nike,Women's Downshifter 9 Sneaker,B07H84HP4K,R3526W9EHDTLZL,"August 5, 2019",5,stylish nike,"Nice fit, room in toe box which is great. I have some athletic shoes that are wide's and don ""t  fit as well as these. Idid go up 1/2 size though, to make sure I had more room."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 9 Sneaker,B07H84HP4K,R2257T186IOLGG,"November 12, 2019",4,"Great, but size up","I am a loyal Nike owner. I have pretty narrow feet with high arches, so Nike shoes always fit me the best without my foot sliding around in them after a few months. That said, these were the tightest 6.5 sneakers I've ever owned by Nike. There was definitely pressure on my first run in these on the tops of my feet and my soles were a little tender from the tighter fit. I'm hoping a few more runs will loosen them up, but I might suggest to anyone who could flip flop between a half size to take the larger in this style just to be safe. That said, they are a really attractive pair of sneakers, especially for runners. Not as much heel support as some others, but if you like a sleeker look and lower profile, these are great for casual or athletic adventures. The colors are vibrant without being too crazy."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 9 Sneaker,B07H84HP4K,R1GJFXB8K4BNJX,"September 8, 2019",4,Comfy,"So far they feel soft and cushiony out of the box.  I normally wear a 10.5 but in Nike sneakers i almost always have to get an 11, i think if you're in between sizes you should go up half the size.  They look nice and very cute, love the colors!  Only time will tell how they will hold up.  The insoles do no appear to be removable, they feel pretty stuck in there."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 9 Sneaker,B07H84HP4K,R14SGUK0PO258J,"August 23, 2019",5,I love them!,These are nice and light and great for walking.  The first time I put them on they felt like they were old favorites.  Very happy with purchase.

Nike,Women's Downshifter 9 Sneaker,B07H84HP4K,R2YZPRAL1SYRZ1,"December 29, 2019",5,Sleek but narrow,"I like the look of these sneakers but they do run small/narrow. I'm a usual 8.5 but had to go up to 9, otherwise its tight over the top of my feet. That said, the long thinner shape does elongate my foot and creates a sleek look, versus some other shoes say, Hoka, which have a bulkier appearance. The shoe itself is not exceptionally comfortable for urban running, as I found the shock absorption less effective than an older cheaper pair of Puma that I have. However they are lightweight and breathe well. I purchased the burgundy / rose-gold color and they look great."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 9 Sneaker,B07H84HP4K,R3FL2AGGZB8J4X,"May 31, 2019",5,Perfect,"Fit great, super comfortable."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 9 Sneaker,B07H84HP4K,RGUAASXSCW04H,"January 28, 2020",4,"Comfortable, but not the best top mesh.","They fit great and are very comfortable I am on my feet all day (I work in a gym) so I need good shoes. My only complaint would be that where my big toe hits the top of the shoes I have a little spot that is worn. This is one both of shoes (pictured is left) I don't really mind, but something to keep in mind when thinking about getting these."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 9 Sneaker,B07H84HP4K,R95ETSJEYXIKV,"December 11, 2019",1,Poor quality,"I only buy Nike shoes and these are not the same quality. I have had them less than 2 months and I take very good care of my shoes but it already has a little hole in the top, I'm guessing from my toenail even though I keep my toenails short. My last pair of Nike shoes bought from Amazon lasted 3 years and the ones previous to those lasted more than 2 years. These lasted less than 2 months. Now I have to spend more money to buy a new pair."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 9 Sneaker,B07H84HP4K,R15N0H1ZUXMI2S,"December 31, 2019",4,They should offer wide size,Quality shoe but too narrow for my sister’s foot. Sizes seem to be about a half off on the smaller side she said. I returned it. Too bad they don’t offer wide on this shoe. It was a really nice shoe.
Nike,Women's Downshifter 9 Sneaker,B07H84HP4K,R3K8SN09RAW0CR,"October 13, 2019",5,So comfortable!,Super cute and comfortable. Love the feel so far. Played tennis in these and they gave me plenty of flexible support with enough cushion. Likely even better for walking and jogging.
Nike,Women's Downshifter 9 Sneaker,B07H84HP4K,R1USQZ4HGSLJQV,"January 5, 2020",5,Great pair of shoes,Bought these for my 21 year old daughter who is extremely picky and she loved the. They fit perfect and looked cute on her. They are exactly as they look and more than expected.

Nike,Women's Free RN 5.0 Running Shoe,B07HB63Q9B,RWGIHHQ6NYBL3,"July 7, 2019",5,LOVE the new Free RN's!,"If you have ever worn a pair of Nike Free's, or a similar light weight shoe, then you will love these. I am very used to wearing Nike shoes and love the light weight feel, but after some negative reviews I read on here about these, I was a bit concerned. Definitely glad I didn't let them cloud my judgement. Some people complained about their feet hurting after going for runs, but keep in mind that Nike has specifically stated that these shoes are NOT long distance running shoes- nothing more than 2-3 miles. The shoes are a very light weight material, and are meant to fit snug against your foot. I seriously never want to take these off, their so comfortable!"
Nike,Women's Free RN 5.0 Running Shoe,B07HB63Q9B,R1RFX79CIT289S,"January 26, 2020",1,"Not for me, but maybe for u ???","Only purchase if ur into the very extremely low low below the ankle type  shoe the kind that digs into ur bones from both sides and if u like feeling nothing under ur toes like ur half bare foot these will work if that's what ur into. They're super cute, but looks are certainly the only thing going for them. Just not my thing I guess... i got a very fast refund thanks AMAZON for that happy with that and will be happy with my next  shoe purchase hope...."
Nike,Women's Free RN 5.0 Running Shoe,B07HB63Q9B,RZDF0HGBZJUG,"January 10, 2020",3,Disappointing!,"The shoes look awesome, but the feel was very disappointing. They’re not particularly bouncy or well cushioned overall but the toe part has almost no cushioning at all. It feels like I’m walking in bare feet towards the toes, and not in a good way. They have less support than the old worn down sneakers I’m replacing. I returned them but I have no doubt that if I’d gone on one run in these my feet would be in pain."
Nike,Women's Free RN 5.0 Running Shoe,B07HB63Q9B,RVJ495WXFKLWW,"June 27, 2019",5,If you wear socks order half size up if your don’t order true size,Comfortable

I usually wear a 7 1/2 to 8, Purchased a size 8 however there are snug as an eight. I will not purchase this style again. not comfortable to wear. Pretty but not practical, not comfortable to wear."

Nike,Women's Free RN 5.0 Running Shoe,B07HB63Q9B,RIBBQ95TEF1ZJ,"January 17, 2020",1,Runs Small  and uncomfortable,"I figured  I was safe ordering any type of Nike free but boy was I wrong with this 5.0 Version . The front of the shoe is very narrow it runs  small compared to the others . It literally feels like your standing on fisher price plastic . Very misleading considering the sole looks like a cloud but it is the very furthest from that.. HARD! . I returned the shoe and got a speedy refund , so that is very much appreciated .  I would stay away from this version of Nike free if you like comfort."
Nike,Women's Free RN 5.0 Running Shoe,B07HB63Q9B,RABRQEGIMCMQ3,"January 14, 2020",1,Design disappointing,I returned this product because I couldn't get the heel in easily. I don't like the soft stretching fabric that you have to pull up in order to get your heel in. Difficult for an older person to do get into. I have always loved the OLDER free run design with soft fabric and  sole comfortability. New design is not appealing to me.
Nike,Women's Free RN 5.0 Running Shoe,B07HB63Q9B,R1EY0TGG80LCK,"July 4, 2019",5,Love them!!,They are so comfortable and look very nice with a sport outfit or jeans
Nike,Women's Free RN 5.0 Running Shoe,B07HB63Q9B,R1KFFV4BABW6MX,"February 13, 2020",4,Cute not comfy,The shoe itself is really cute. But if you are looking for comfort these are not it. They are kinda hard on the inside. Will take some breaking in. Very fitting so if you have a wide foot this may be too tight on your feet. The only running i would do in these is errands.

They are hard to find now and thought I would try this one as an option. They are comfortable but they are more narrow in the toe area.  I wear an 8 medium, and this is my only problem with the shoe. I do cross training and outdoor walking."

I am on my feet for 10 hours at work, and at the end of the day my feet always hurt due to swelling. I gave 4 stars because there is no arch support. After I inserted Dr. Scholl's work massaging gel insoles, they feel like walking on clouds!"
Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 8 Cross,B079V77HGV,R3G17RLMVOCPJO,"August 10, 2019",5,Love them,"These are just the right pair of shoes I was looking for, light and for basic workouts. I would not recommend these for long walks or running due to very little arch support and not an over all comfort support for that kind of workout. These also run narrow in shoe size but for the perfect fit I recommend still buying your shoe size but just in wide. Trust me if you buy a wide in your shoe size they will fit like your normal shoe size not bigger. Wide is not really wide with these shoes. I would Not recommend buying a size up because they will be to long/big, I brought my shoe size but in wide and they fit perfect, like my normal shoe size with out the wide. They will look small when you see them in person but if you order your size in wide they should fit you perfect. If you have narrow feet the you can just order your shoe size and they will be perfect for you because these are already narrow fitting."

Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 8 Cross,B079V77HGV,R2V8K7WBWM72ZE,"September 27, 2019",2,My Feet Hurt,"These look great! Buyer beware if you’re looking to gift these shoes; the Nike box that it came in was so beat up (a tear on the top, dents on the box, a rip on the side), I was a little nervous to open the box or scared I’d find bugs in it. Shoes look awesome though. Can’t wait to wear these in the gym :) **UPDATE** If you lift weights, DO NOT WEAR these on leg day. These shoes suck. They hurt the ankle & back part of my feet & being in pain because your shoes are high in the back and create friction with your ankles ruined my entire workout. I would return these if I could but I’ve already worn them a few times for chest & back day. Safe to say I really hate these, and I’m not happy."

They seem to have changed the shape of the shoe, with this version.  It looks longer and is narrow across the bridge of my foot.  Just not comfortable and kind of weird looking.  Sending back and going to search out an earlier version. I use this for circuit training."

I have narrow feet so sometimes shoes can feel too wide but these fit great and provide wonderful support. They were even comfortable the whole first day that wore them! I have not done any high impact exercising in them but I am on my feet all day and these shoes have felt great.
Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 8 Cross,B079V77HGV,R1HHMWCMRTZP72,"July 24, 2019",1,"Uncomfortable, Sent back",I have several pair of Nike training shoes and love them.  There was something wrong with these.  I couldn't get through one fitness class wearing them.  They were so uncomfortable.  I gave them a second try hoping I just needed to break them in.  Still incredibly uncomfortable.  I believe they were flawed because I do love my other Nike shoes.
Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 8 Cross,B079V77HGV,R32GKO0QF32X3V,"September 11, 2019",4,Too small,I have naturally narrow feet so I never have to order wide shoes. However when I tried the shoes on they were so tight on the side it was giving my feet cramps.

They're not the most supportive shoes I own but they're fine for a few hours of exercising or walking. I need orthotics so won't wear these for heavy walking but love them for Zumba and other activities when I need flexibility in my shoes.

A beat up box doesn’t mean beaten up shoes, so I opened it to find the shoes and a receipt from Finishline (not where these are shipped or sold from according to amazon). I check out the shoes and while they look clean, I can’t help but feel like I received a used pair of shoes that have seen somebody else’s feet. The receipt itself has somebody else’s address on it, a guy from New York. I’m not sure if I’m willing to kee this since I paid 80 bucks for apparently used shoes..."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,R2YFNMJA0BWA2T,"February 14, 2018",1,They don’t look anything like the picture of the color I ordered,I have several of the Nike Pegasus shoes and I believe these are fake or possibly mislabeled. They came in a standard brown box (not a Nike box) and they feel very cheap. They don’t look anything like the picture of the color I ordered. I have started the return process.
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,R2CXKJ7Z3NP9JB,"January 5, 2019",3,"Ankle dips awkwardly low, lack of support","I am running a marathon in April and I needed new shoes to train and run in. I have always run in Nikes, although lately I haven't loved the way they look. I tried a few other brands (Brooks Running, Asics, New Balance) but they didn't feel right to me, so I went back to Nike and settled on the Nike Pegasus 35, thinking it was the best option. I wore them once and they seemed okay, but I've just put them on for a second time and I can't help but feel that the dips by the ankle are very low. It feels like there isn't a ton of support around my ankle, and it actually feels as though the back of my foot is going to lift up out of the shoe when I run. It's really frustrating. Because it seems so shallow, I doubt you would be able to fit any sort of orthotic insert into this shoe and be able to wear it comfortably. And, because the sides dip low around the ankle, any socks, even ones meant to be ""no show"" stick out. I also don't love that the tongue of the shoe is super long. It sticks up and hits the top of the front of my ankle when I run. Overall the whole ankle area of this shoe is awkward. I'm worried that I'm going to develop ankle problems from training in them without stability, but at this point I've already worn them and can't afford a second pair."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,R2XSP5RDIWSMV8,"September 5, 2018",5,Air Zoom is the bomb diggity!,"I’ve only had these for a couple of weeks but so far so great! The shoelaces are way too short though. But otherwise they are pretty awesome. I’ve been dealing with Runner’s knee on and off, and I honestly think running in these shoes is helping it get better. I know that sounds crazy, but I’m telling you...it’s true. They are super cushiony but not too much. And I typically wear an 8.5 in women’s ascics and I got an 8.5 in these and they fit great. This air zoom stuff is the bomb diggity!"

Her orthopedist recommended these shoes, and to be honest, we were hesitant at first because we have boght so many other tennis shoes and simply wasted our money on them.  She put these on as soon as they arrived, and she hasn't wanted to take them off since! They fit securely, but they leave plenty of room for the foot to move around in as she walks. We will definitely buy another pair in the fall!"
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,R2K4QPSJ7JN2GJ,"October 1, 2018",1,Fits small and restocking fee,Didn't read reviews before purchasing so didn't know Nike Runs smaller.

I have regular width feet and these were so snug the sides of my feet were curving - worst run of my life!!  I thought they might get better after a few minutes but I had to take them off and walk in my socks a mile home in pain.  I have always been a size 9 and have never felt a shoe so small that it instantly makes your feet go numb.  I thought I might order a size up, but after having to pay to return them, I decided to buy a different shoe all together.  Maybe if you have super narrow feet these are for you."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,R1MRNP1C8MZK98,"November 13, 2018",1,Extremely tight compared all previous Pegasus,"Way too tight compared with the fit of all previous Nike Pegasus over the past 5 years. They squeeze your feet and put pressure on your toenails, extremely painful after a full day of wearing them. At first I thought it was just because they were new so I tried just wearing them once or twice a week at first but they never loosened up, and you can't even loosen them with the laces because the tongue is sewn in all the way up. Very disappointing for the price I paid that the product is so drastically different from the shoes I'd been buying for years, and I can't even return them now that I've worn them."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,R1KLUTSN8KYGDV,"July 17, 2018",5,"Comfortable, cushioned and quality running shoe!","This is my 4th or 5th pair of Nike Pegasus (I think my first pair was 24?), but I haven’t had a new pair in a few years. I’m training for a half marathon right now and alternate these and a pair of Nike flex. I have 25 miles on these shoes so far and they will definitely be comfortable throughout training! I was having some ankle and knee pain, so decided it was time for some new running shoes! The mesh on these is very comfortable, they have great cushion and arch support without being heavy and they’ve been friendly on my knees and ankles! I usually wear 8/8.5, but I’ve always bought size 9 in Pegasus (I like to size up for running shoes) and it’s the perfect size. My only complaint is that the toe box is a little looser than I’d like, but I can deal with it."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,RU2ABOLZ5AFA8,"September 11, 2018",5,Great shoe!,"I normally wear the Nike Flyknit, which have a bit of stretch. The Pegasus is not as flexible, but gives great support. They are so comfortable! My knees feel much better when exercising, now."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,R1284Y8KAPQ2JP,"April 17, 2019",3,Anchored tongue means no adjustments to widen - shoelaces useless,"I love Nike shoes, they always fit me perfectly. This Pegasus was no exception. EXCEPT that the tongue is stitched to the side of the shoe opening so you cannot make adjustments to widen the opening! Once you've gotten your foot inside it, often requiring a shoehorn for me, you can tighten the shoe. But there is no loosening allowed. This odd design turned into a huge problem for me when I travelled and my feet swelled for a few days. Forcing my feet into these was torturous. And, because I could not loosen them, they caused cuts and pressure sores on the tops of my feet. I'd have done better with a pair of sneakers. Or some other slip-on shoe, for a lot less money!"

I've worn this Nike Pegasus shoes for all 35 years they've been produced. When you find a great 4E shoe why change? I have tried other more stylish sneakers, and they're fine for a few hours, but the Pegasus shoes I wear every single day, all day long. As a teacher I'm on my feet a lot, walking around a large campus, and these are perfect!"
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,R1838XLS1M35L,"March 9, 2019",1,Don’t buy this style,The heel sticks out in a triangle. They ruined the design. It looks like a horn on the end. I am angry I purchased this. I have worn the same brand for six years and they redid the style and the back of it looks stupid. And now I have to wear them like this. It’s not the same Pegasus Nike I am use to. Run with the shoes you have in the opposite direction from this style. Stupid stupid
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,R1WJ52IG9SZSMH,"January 30, 2019",1,Nike Air Zoom,"It looks really neat, but wearing this shoes is something else.  It's NOT COMFORTABLE.  The foot bed is bumpy.  The size 7 should have plenty of toe room, but this shoe does not.  A size 7.5 might haver solved the problem.  Don't really know.  Looks are deceiving."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,R2TA7058AHYQCB,"June 6, 2019",5,8.5 wide (i normally get 8),"normally wear 8 in women (adidas) and 5.5 or 6 in kids (depending on brand), but I ordered up a .5 size because it seems that some Nike running shoes seems to run small. I tried this on when I got it in the mail and went out for a run. The only downside to this is around the ankles, as they feel lacking support. Positives are the cushion (I have metatarsal issues on my right foot and a bit of an arch pain), and it's lightweight- which makes runs smoother for me. I usually run about 2 miles (not insanely long distance) but I can walk the rest of the day in these after my runs. One of the best Nike running Ive owned. I'd buy it again."

Unfortunately, it looks like the shoes I received has already been worn. There’s gravel in the bottom rubber and a sticker tag inside the shoe that’s been worn off. It’s really unfortunate that I received these shoes in this condition considering the amount I’ve paid for them."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,R382CUIWWTJ5SJ,"April 26, 2019",4,Size up 1/2 a size,"I bought these after researching marathon training shoes and this one made several of the lists. Unfortunately, my area is lacking in quality shoe stores that have sufficient stock. The shoe itself is nice and would've been perfect if I had ordered a 1/2 size up. I wear a 9.5 in the Winflo and have plenty of room for my toes, but this shoe is snug for me. Thinking they would stretch out a bit, I ran 5 miles to break them in, but my toes were sore afterward. So, they will be used for lifting weights and the exercise bike on my off days. I really like the style of this shoe and the color options as well, but size up a 1/2 size if you're planning on running in them!"
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,RMC8RAWLTYWZ1,"August 21, 2018",4,Fits me a little bigger than the 7.5 has in the past .,"Been wearing Nike Pegasus for like 10+ years now, still very happy with the shoe overall. Style has changed quite a bit. My least favorite change is the shark fin deal by the heel. I love the color ! I was surprised by the dark blue , for some reason i thought I was getting black and pink , but that was my fault. I usually always get a 7.5 in this shoe , but I will say these feel slightly bigger than my older ones . I’ll probably stick with I though because as a runner , if my shoe is too small I’ll lose toe nails . Seller shipped the shoe faster than I expected which is great! Overall very happy with the shoe and the seller."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Running Shoe,B07199FDWX,R1K9DWKEE16C55,"September 4, 2019",5,Pegasus great mid range support shoe.,"I’ve worn Nike Pegasus for about 14 years. I actually switched brands briefly when they started putting the Pod in the sole because when they did that, they had to split the footbed in half to accommodate the pod. That was a terrible design and it made a noticeable difference in the integrity of the support. When other shows didn’t work, I was ordering old models of the Pegasus from discount stores and when they came back to the Pegasus with no pod, I was THRILLED. I will wear Pegasus for life. Shoes are a very individual thing so what works for one may not work for another. I’m neither an over or under pronator so these shoes are perfect for me"

I have an arched foot so it’s been hard for me to find a pair that doesn’t make my feet hurt after a few hours . I wore these all day at Disneyland and my feet were completely supported the entire time . I will be ordering more colors

With a 8 week challenge at my gym I needed a replacement ASAP and avoiding the mall at all costs. Guess I should have went in. I got an 8.5 because I read they ran small. I normally wear 8s and these fit like an 8. From the picture you can see they are almost green/grey. I’m not returning as I love any roshe but just writing this review if someone is expecting something more along the lines of WHITE. Lol
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B01IDLDQ80,R26HNRDBVRZ7KP,"April 24, 2017",5,Comfortable and stylish!,"I ordered these based on my daughter's recommendation.  She and her husband both love there's.  Comfortable and stylish.  I like the all-white.  It's a clean look.  And when they need it, these clean up very easily.  The fabric is very lightweight and dries quickly.  As far as comfort, these are amazing.  I have trouble with pressure points on most shoes.  Not on these!  I don't run in them, but fitness walk 5 miles, three times per week, where I find the support adequate.  Highly recommended."

These sneakers were made for my feet,"When you find a sneaker that takes 30 years off your feet, you LOVE them. These sneakers were made for my feet. Just the right height and shape arch support. Tallish toe box, so my toenails don't get irritated. Just wide enough for my somewhat widish foot. I haven't been able to run in a long time due to plantar fasciitis, but with these on, I run my dogs when they want to run and I don't even feel it in my feet. I now own 30 pair in different colors. I don't think they make them anymore. I'm stocking up for the rest of my life."
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B01IDLDQ80,R3RRSLENV2OPHA,"March 10, 2017",4,Not bad for $62!,"Received today...I have the black camouflage.  I selected ""fits as expected"" because I ordered a half size up based on reviews that the sneaker runs small. That said, having ordered a half size up, the shoe fits well. I can tell by the fit and the material that if I had ordered an 8 (my regular size), my feet would have been unhappy. The 8.5 fits well with plenty of room for my orthotics. The shoe appears to be well made and is very, very comfortable. I have given 4 stars because I don't yet know how they will hold up after some typical wear and tear. I have been wearing these all day and am very happy. The material is extremely light weight but warm enough with cotton socks to wear in 39 degree weather."

Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B01IDLDQ80,R32L87TMM1CVT7,"August 20, 2019",5,They don't work out,"Received the slippers. The number in the size chart is not correct, 8.5 says 9 7/8 inches and 25 centimeters and is not, is one more number. 8.5 is a number 9. The shoes are not comfortable, they feel hard, I don't think I can use them for exercise. I will use them to dress normally, they look beautiful with my outfit"
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B01IDLDQ80,R2R4KAP91276NJ,"January 23, 2020",5,My favorite shoes for anything,I’ve tried on quite a few tennis shoes and the only ones that felt comfortable right out the box were Nike roshe. I have an average width foot and high arches. And these help cushion the constant heel pain that I have. Already own a size 9 of Nike roshe in black that are a few years old. Saw the silver ones and they fit perfect. Just like my old pair. Thought a little metallic would be a fun addition to the dark colors I normally wear. But the color is ALOT brighter than the photo. Are bright silver instead of dark pewter that is pictured. It isn’t enough that I don’t like them but fair warning if your attached to the dark metallic grey. Conclusion is Roshe’s are still the winners for me.
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B01IDLDQ80,R2RJ4JYLSNV1B9,"March 6, 2017",1,Huge disappointment,"I was so excited to get these, and they had two good reviews. These shoes are a huge disappointment. They are long and skinny. The toe box is only about an inch wide. It's like trying to get your foot into a pencil. I don't have a particularly wide foot, and regular Nikes always worked for me before, these have got to be defective or something, I've never seen a shoe so long and skinny. Returning these."
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B01IDLDQ80,R30DO686PPGUDH,"June 22, 2017",4,I love love love the color of these shoes,I love love love the color of these shoes. My only complaint is that these have the worse insoles of any nikes I have ever purchased and I had to immediately change them out with storebought insoles. They were not flexible and had ridges that hurt the bottom of my feet. I wear a 6 and the 6 fit perfectly. Very easy to clean.
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B01IDLDQ80,R2BSB6W5NXFA9O,"September 24, 2019",5,My Daughters Favorite!,"My daughter has been wearing Roche's for years.  The last pair lasted almost 5 years.  Although she is now almost 17, her feet have grown since the original purchase and yet she refused to get a new pair.  She loved them that much.  I finally surprised her with a new pair and she was very happy.  All of her running shoes/sneakers are Nike, it would be hard to get her to wear another pair!"
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B01IDLDQ80,R2IIP4IX78GM8G,"June 24, 2019",1,Knock offs,"Upon closer inspection and comparing to pictures on nike website of the same shoes, these are not the same as the pair shown on Nike's website. They fit fine but since I'm looking for shoes that will support me when I'm running, I don't trust these to do the job. I am returning them."
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B01IDLDQ80,R1EFNGLSYB62CY,"July 17, 2019",2,Cheaply made,"I normally wear a narrow size in Nike sneakers. But since they have chosen to no longer support that population, I'm trying some of the M widths. I would say this shoe pretty much runs true to size for a M width. The material,  however, seemed cheap and the loop on the tongue was defective on both shoes. Not worth the money even if it had fit."

It has been on my phone for couple of weeks and has completely unstuck on the right side. I have press extra hard to get the protective cover back down against the screen for it to register my touch on the screen. Also, it says it work with the fingerprint reader, IT DOES NOT! Have not been able to use the fingerprint since putting this screen on my phone. Just keeps telling me to press harder when I cover the fingerprint area. Headed to ATT to buy an authorized dealer screen protector now. Never should've tried to save some $$ with this junk that's on my phone now!"

I am usually a size 6 in Nike shoes, but reviews told me to size a half size up because roshe's run a bit smaller than normal. Ended up fitting quite well! My only complaints for these shoes are the insoles. TRASH! Literally cardboard! And it's a little wide on the pinky toe side, but nothing too unbearable. I'd recommend. 9/10!"
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B01IDLDQ80,R313T9UFKOG2M9,"May 23, 2019",5,"Glittery, beautiful and comfortable",These look amazing and are super comfortable. When I first put them on they felt slightly narrow and I def noticed a strong arch support but after one day of wearing I acclimated and they are my favorites right now!
Nike,Women's Low-Top Trainers,B01IDLDQ80,R3B9RONCCHHDQV,"August 30, 2016",1,Don't waste your time and money,"If I could give this product zero stars, I so would. Don't waste your time and money, just go to a shoe store and buy real Nikes, these are horrible. The box came beaten up which was already not a good sign, they got my size WRONG, and the product itself looks cheap asf and like it was made with only $.50 invested in materials.  I checked the seller and of course it came from a foreign country. It looks like they bought $10 Walmart athletic shoes, slapped on a Nike logo, and attached Nike tags in hopes of it passing off as a Nike product. Don't even bother with buying these. I'll consider changing this review if I get my $55 back ASAP."

These are so much easier to run in during workouts than the 2s and 3s. Stable enough to lift in and flexible enough to do movements like burpees, box jumps, etc. would highly recommend."
Nike,Metcon 4 Womens Running Shoes,B07BSQSSZ6,RD5Y9YLI83E90,"December 17, 2018",5,.,These feel super snug without being too tight.  Also  I’m pretty sure the shiny part makes me run faster.

I have been lifting weights in just running shoes and my workout partner finally convinced me to get weight lifting shoes. I tried on a bunch and these are the only ones that fit me right. I have long narrow-ish feet and these work well for people like me! I love how flat they are on the bottom. I feel a lot more balanced when I'm squatting now.
Nike,Metcon 4 Womens Running Shoes,B07BSQSSZ6,R3AEYYSQGVV2RQ,"February 17, 2019",5,Better than No Bull and REEBOKnano,"I’ve tried 3 CrossFit shoes, the Reebok nano, NO BULL, Nike metcon. I have high arches and the the no bulls and nanos killed my feet. They would cramp up during the work out. I even tried with high end inserts for support and still cramped during the workout. 3rd shoe was the metcon, but switched out the insole for my support one and worked out without my feet cramping up. If you have high arches I’d recommend this one with an insert."
Nike,Metcon 4 Womens Running Shoes,B07BSQSSZ6,R3SC4XKR41PY3P,"January 26, 2019",5,Awesome!,LOVE THE SHOES! I wear them for working out and they are super comfortable. They help with stability in lunges and other single-leg exercises.

I bought a size 5.5 in a different color to see if that would be good, but just a tad too snug, so on to find better fitting training shoes. The toe box has stretched a bunch, too. I have ordered some socks that look thicker with hopes they help. I’m also going to buy different shoestrings. The ones that come with them don’t stay tied and they are way way too long. The look of them is nice, though."
Nike,Metcon 4 Womens Running Shoes,B07BSQSSZ6,RIUQ3YVV469K,"June 2, 2019",4,Packaging?,"Hope these are legitimate metcons. These shoes arrived without their original box in a clear bag, no tags, and what looks like cat hairs inside the shoe! Nevertheless, my daughter kept them and said they feel comfortable."
Nike,Metcon 4 Womens Running Shoes,B07BSQSSZ6,R28XYSKQUBE16B,"January 15, 2020",2,Great at first. But then...,"I’ve had these shoes for four months now. They were great at first. Looked great. Felt decent (a little more firm than I have been used to). But, after four months of wearing them to workout 3 days a week the sole is starting to separate from the upper. I really thought these shoes would last a lot longer. I don’t do rope climbs. I mainly do barbell workouts with box jumps and burpees (with the occasional core workout). I would buy these shoes just for weightlifting not for functional training."

Compared to my last running shoe, this shoe feels more stable, my foot isn’t slipping around in the shoe. The toe box is wider than running shoe, but perfectly so. Adds to comfort level. The color is a lighter grey than the pic shows. Good looking shoe!"
Nike,Metcon 4 Womens Running Shoes,B07BSQSSZ6,RLSKS2W4CM1D7,"June 11, 2019",5,Love them,I was worried about getting white metcons since I do CrossFit on black mats but I’m really happy with my choice 3 weeks later. Sooo comfortable.  I did run a mile in them and ended up w shin splints tho. Def change if u need to run longer than 400 meters
Nike,Metcon 4 Womens Running Shoes,B07BSQSSZ6,R1SD8JCAQUU80L,"August 15, 2019",4,Interesting,"These have a different fit from what I’m used to. Definitely for more narrow feet like mine. No padding in the sole to speak of, so you do feel very connected to the ground. Time will tell how these work out. Not for walking, I think."
Nike,Metcon 4 Womens Running Shoes,B07BSQSSZ6,R36MFGMPBEGZ8D,"August 1, 2018",2,Got some blister pain.,"I was so excited to get these shoes after reading an article citing them as the preferred crossfit shoe. They fit as expected, did not feel tight or loose, but I got huge blisters at the same place on each foot. Thick vs thin socks did not help prevent the issue."
Nike,Metcon 4 Womens Running Shoes,B07BSQSSZ6,R1DXY1ESM32T3S,"November 28, 2019",5,Very happy,"After 2 workouts, I am very satisfied with my pair. I got the flower pattern design, which is awesome and no one has it in my gym :) You can't see the inside of the show in the pic here, but it's sort of an inverted version of the outside pattern, which looks amazing (even though only I can see it). Great attention to detail. The shoelaces come untied too easily even with a double knot. I might replace them, but no big deal."

Nike,Metcon 4 Womens Running Shoes,B07BSQSSZ6,RFJGDDHX4C0FS,"July 7, 2019",5,Worth the money!,These shoes are very supportive. I feel steady when I’m on the elliptical and the treadmill. Nice breathable material and the fit is good. I sized up a half a size for extra sock room. I’m glad I did.

Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 9 Sneaker,B07HDSRJML,R3A7VBCTZUA29O,"July 8, 2019",3,Not for impact.,"Very comfortable but little arch support. Unfortunately I need arch support and these are a very flat sole with light cushion to absorb some impact. I honestly cannot imagine using these for high impact or for an extended period. I think they would be fine for lifting or low-impact workouts but I would not use them for running. The upper is very comfortable and I like a roomy toebox and don’t want things touching my toes. Overall, fit as expected."

Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 9 Sneaker,B07HDSRJML,RGZSXVHDBFOSV,"January 6, 2020",2,Disappointing Fit,"The area under the tongue of the shoe rubbed against the top of my foot and was quite uncomfortable. Otherwise, I liked the larger toe box and it fit like a size 7. Unfortunately, I had to return the shoes due to the rubbing and pressure from part of the shoe."

These are casual shoes for a sporty outfit or low impact days at the gym. Might be ok for light walking on even terrain but nothing more. Quality is what I expected and they work great for my casual dress days or kids sporting events.
Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 9 Sneaker,B07HDSRJML,RNXROBL8P3QZ0,"September 29, 2019",2,Cute but poor fit,Adorable style but awful fit. I wear an 11 but have to size up to 12 in Nike because they run small. Tried these on and they were baggy in the heel which is so weird..but tight across the top. And poor support doesnt feel like much padding in the sole.

By Thursday when I received them, the price had decreased by $11... lol, what a joke. Isn’t cyber Monday supposed to be the biggest sale day of the year?? So I’m addition to not really loving the shoes, I’m going to return them just because Amazon tried to pull one over on me with the price!"

I am an 8 in woman and ordered a 7.5....if you're feet are wide like mine, but not too wide, just go with your normal size. They were tight on my toes!!

I ended up taking the advice of others and sizing down which was bad. I wear these without socks so that’s a bonus but still wish I had ordered my normal size.

Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R18HKRMEEN0XZL,"June 14, 2018",1,They look nice but...,"Upon opening my package, I noticed the box itself looked pretty beaten up and had obviously been that way for a bit because there’s even tape on one corner to hold it together. A beat up box doesn’t mean beaten up shoes, so I opened it to find the shoes and a receipt from Finishline (not where these are shipped or sold from according to amazon). I check out the shoes and while they look clean, I can’t help but feel like I received a used pair of shoes that have seen somebody else’s feet. The receipt itself has somebody else’s address on it, a guy from New York. I’m not sure if I’m willing to kee this since I paid 80 bucks for apparently used shoes..."
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R2YFNMJA0BWA2T,"February 14, 2018",1,They don’t look anything like the picture of the color I ordered,I have several of the Nike Pegasus shoes and I believe these are fake or possibly mislabeled. They came in a standard brown box (not a Nike box) and they feel very cheap. They don’t look anything like the picture of the color I ordered. I have started the return process.
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R2CXKJ7Z3NP9JB,"January 5, 2019",3,"Ankle dips awkwardly low, lack of support","I am running a marathon in April and I needed new shoes to train and run in. I have always run in Nikes, although lately I haven't loved the way they look. I tried a few other brands (Brooks Running, Asics, New Balance) but they didn't feel right to me, so I went back to Nike and settled on the Nike Pegasus 35, thinking it was the best option. I wore them once and they seemed okay, but I've just put them on for a second time and I can't help but feel that the dips by the ankle are very low. It feels like there isn't a ton of support around my ankle, and it actually feels as though the back of my foot is going to lift up out of the shoe when I run. It's really frustrating. Because it seems so shallow, I doubt you would be able to fit any sort of orthotic insert into this shoe and be able to wear it comfortably. And, because the sides dip low around the ankle, any socks, even ones meant to be ""no show"" stick out. I also don't love that the tongue of the shoe is super long. It sticks up and hits the top of the front of my ankle when I run. Overall the whole ankle area of this shoe is awkward. I'm worried that I'm going to develop ankle problems from training in them without stability, but at this point I've already worn them and can't afford a second pair."
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R2XSP5RDIWSMV8,"September 5, 2018",5,Air Zoom is the bomb diggity!,"I’ve only had these for a couple of weeks but so far so great! The shoelaces are way too short though. But otherwise they are pretty awesome. I’ve been dealing with Runner’s knee on and off, and I honestly think running in these shoes is helping it get better. I know that sounds crazy, but I’m telling you...it’s true. They are super cushiony but not too much. And I typically wear an 8.5 in women’s ascics and I got an 8.5 in these and they fit great. This air zoom stuff is the bomb diggity!"
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R3QG6C64XJ5I67,"August 17, 2017",5,Her orthopedist recommended these shoes,"My daughter has tendonitis, and her feet hurt in every single closed shoe, athletic or otherwise. Her orthopedist recommended these shoes, and to be honest, we were hesitant at first because we have boght so many other tennis shoes and simply wasted our money on them.  She put these on as soon as they arrived, and she hasn't wanted to take them off since! They fit securely, but they leave plenty of room for the foot to move around in as she walks. We will definitely buy another pair in the fall!"
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R2K4QPSJ7JN2GJ,"October 1, 2018",1,Fits small and restocking fee,Didn't read reviews before purchasing so didn't know Nike Runs smaller. But yeah they fit too small ALSO!!!! Before you purchase know that if you return you will get a 20% restocking fee... Something they don't mention.

Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R61JPRQ67F61K,"November 28, 2018",3,WAY too tight,"I was so excited to try these after reading how comfortable and good for runners knee they were.  I have regular width feet and these were so snug the sides of my feet were curving - worst run of my life!!  I thought they might get better after a few minutes but I had to take them off and walk in my socks a mile home in pain.  I have always been a size 9 and have never felt a shoe so small that it instantly makes your feet go numb.  I thought I might order a size up, but after having to pay to return them, I decided to buy a different shoe all together.  Maybe if you have super narrow feet these are for you."
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R1MRNP1C8MZK98,"November 13, 2018",1,Extremely tight compared all previous Pegasus,"Way too tight compared with the fit of all previous Nike Pegasus over the past 5 years. They squeeze your feet and put pressure on your toenails, extremely painful after a full day of wearing them. At first I thought it was just because they were new so I tried just wearing them once or twice a week at first but they never loosened up, and you can't even loosen them with the laces because the tongue is sewn in all the way up. Very disappointing for the price I paid that the product is so drastically different from the shoes I'd been buying for years, and I can't even return them now that I've worn them."
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R1KLUTSN8KYGDV,"July 17, 2018",5,"Comfortable, cushioned and quality running shoe!","This is my 4th or 5th pair of Nike Pegasus (I think my first pair was 24?), but I haven’t had a new pair in a few years. I’m training for a half marathon right now and alternate these and a pair of Nike flex. I have 25 miles on these shoes so far and they will definitely be comfortable throughout training! I was having some ankle and knee pain, so decided it was time for some new running shoes! The mesh on these is very comfortable, they have great cushion and arch support without being heavy and they’ve been friendly on my knees and ankles! I usually wear 8/8.5, but I’ve always bought size 9 in Pegasus (I like to size up for running shoes) and it’s the perfect size. My only complaint is that the toe box is a little looser than I’d like, but I can deal with it."
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,RU2ABOLZ5AFA8,"September 11, 2018",5,Great shoe!,"I normally wear the Nike Flyknit, which have a bit of stretch. The Pegasus is not as flexible, but gives great support. They are so comfortable! My knees feel much better when exercising, now."
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R1284Y8KAPQ2JP,"April 17, 2019",3,Anchored tongue means no adjustments to widen - shoelaces useless,"I love Nike shoes, they always fit me perfectly. This Pegasus was no exception. EXCEPT that the tongue is stitched to the side of the shoe opening so you cannot make adjustments to widen the opening! Once you've gotten your foot inside it, often requiring a shoehorn for me, you can tighten the shoe. But there is no loosening allowed. This odd design turned into a huge problem for me when I travelled and my feet swelled for a few days. Forcing my feet into these was torturous. And, because I could not loosen them, they caused cuts and pressure sores on the tops of my feet. I'd have done better with a pair of sneakers. Or some other slip-on shoe, for a lot less money!"
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,RSG1PUG4O4E0P,"April 20, 2019",5,Hard to find Black 4E,"I paid a few bucks more for the black-gunsmoke color but am fine as they are hard to find. I've worn this Nike Pegasus shoes for all 35 years they've been produced. When you find a great 4E shoe why change? I have tried other more stylish sneakers, and they're fine for a few hours, but the Pegasus shoes I wear every single day, all day long. As a teacher I'm on my feet a lot, walking around a large campus, and these are perfect!"
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R1838XLS1M35L,"March 9, 2019",1,Don’t buy this style,The heel sticks out in a triangle. They ruined the design. It looks like a horn on the end. I am angry I purchased this. I have worn the same brand for six years and they redid the style and the back of it looks stupid. And now I have to wear them like this. It’s not the same Pegasus Nike I am use to. Run with the shoes you have in the opposite direction from this style. Stupid stupid
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R1WJ52IG9SZSMH,"January 30, 2019",1,Nike Air Zoom,"It looks really neat, but wearing this shoes is something else.  It's NOT COMFORTABLE.  The foot bed is bumpy.  The size 7 should have plenty of toe room, but this shoe does not.  A size 7.5 might haver solved the problem.  Don't really know.  Looks are deceiving."
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R2TA7058AHYQCB,"June 6, 2019",5,8.5 wide (i normally get 8),"normally wear 8 in women (adidas) and 5.5 or 6 in kids (depending on brand), but I ordered up a .5 size because it seems that some Nike running shoes seems to run small. I tried this on when I got it in the mail and went out for a run. The only downside to this is around the ankles, as they feel lacking support. Positives are the cushion (I have metatarsal issues on my right foot and a bit of an arch pain), and it's lightweight- which makes runs smoother for me. I usually run about 2 miles (not insanely long distance) but I can walk the rest of the day in these after my runs. One of the best Nike running Ive owned. I'd buy it again."
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R1RTT7XFW5BU0P,"January 28, 2019",2,Received already worn shoes,"I’ve been wanting to find this color of shoes for a while and was happy to find it here. Unfortunately, it looks like the shoes I received has already been worn. There’s gravel in the bottom rubber and a sticker tag inside the shoe that’s been worn off. It’s really unfortunate that I received these shoes in this condition considering the amount I’ve paid for them."
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R382CUIWWTJ5SJ,"April 26, 2019",4,Size up 1/2 a size,"I bought these after researching marathon training shoes and this one made several of the lists. Unfortunately, my area is lacking in quality shoe stores that have sufficient stock. The shoe itself is nice and would've been perfect if I had ordered a 1/2 size up. I wear a 9.5 in the Winflo and have plenty of room for my toes, but this shoe is snug for me. Thinking they would stretch out a bit, I ran 5 miles to break them in, but my toes were sore afterward. So, they will be used for lifting weights and the exercise bike on my off days. I really like the style of this shoe and the color options as well, but size up a 1/2 size if you're planning on running in them!"
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,RMC8RAWLTYWZ1,"August 21, 2018",4,Fits me a little bigger than the 7.5 has in the past .,"Been wearing Nike Pegasus for like 10+ years now, still very happy with the shoe overall. Style has changed quite a bit. My least favorite change is the shark fin deal by the heel. I love the color ! I was surprised by the dark blue , for some reason i thought I was getting black and pink , but that was my fault. I usually always get a 7.5 in this shoe , but I will say these feel slightly bigger than my older ones . I’ll probably stick with I though because as a runner , if my shoe is too small I’ll lose toe nails . Seller shipped the shoe faster than I expected which is great! Overall very happy with the shoe and the seller."
Nike,Women's Running Shoes,B07BQX949W,R1K9DWKEE16C55,"September 4, 2019",5,Pegasus great mid range support shoe.,"I’ve worn Nike Pegasus for about 14 years. I actually switched brands briefly when they started putting the Pod in the sole because when they did that, they had to split the footbed in half to accommodate the pod. That was a terrible design and it made a noticeable difference in the integrity of the support. When other shows didn’t work, I was ordering old models of the Pegasus from discount stores and when they came back to the Pegasus with no pod, I was THRILLED. I will wear Pegasus for life. Shoes are a very individual thing so what works for one may not work for another. I’m neither an over or under pronator so these shoes are perfect for me"

They are really so very comfortable and light weight and it's not necessary to wear socks because the inside of the shoe is smooth and soft on the heel.  They are so very comfortable I got the same ones, but no pink for my husband and he love them too...."

Although, these are not great support for very long distance, they were very comfortable for up to 10 miles. My daughter visited and loved the fit. I bought her a pair and she does run.  Says they are great!"

They fit beautifully and are the most comfortable walking shoes I’ve ever had.  A little disappointed that I ordered another EXACT same pair two days later for my daughter and hers were $48.75 while mine were $64.99.  Pretty upset about that but otherwise love the product.
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 8 Shoe,B00SF6DKX0,R1GBBWQ2M956JY,"June 2, 2019",5,Thank you Amazon for a painless exchange.,"I ordered my true to size (11) and had to exchange for a half size larger....which is unusual for me, but I'm glad I did. The fit is amazing. They're very lightweight, and the support in the arch and heel feels like you're walking barefoot but better. I'm looking forward to my Disney trip in these babies. My true size was just a little too short. The reinforced area in the toe of the shoe pushed up on the nail of my big toe. The extra length in the half size made them perfect. If you have long feet, consider sizing up to a half size. Either way Amazon made my exchange very easy."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 8 Shoe,B00SF6DKX0,RSIL63VNEF8L0,"April 15, 2019",5,Very comfortable exercise shoe,"Specially like the exterior fabric and design. It is a lightweight, comfortable exercise shoe, which can also work well as casual wear."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 8 Shoe,B00SF6DKX0,R36N0B7LUJAL0H,"July 14, 2019",3,Weird color,I want to like these shoes... but in person the color is more like a dark 'jegging' or denim color.  All I can think of are jeggings when I look at these.  But it's kind of nice to have a pair of shoes you don't like that much because I can get them dirty without stressing.  If I am going somewhere muddy or dirty to walk or hike these are my go to pair of tennis shoes.
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 8 Shoe,B00SF6DKX0,RKEJUX8KKTG29,"June 8, 2019",3,They were to small and I’m always a size five in women’s shoes,So I just  received the shoes today and I tried them on and they seemed very thin maybe because they want them to be breathable I don’t know really. The reason why I have it three stars is because they are in my opinion expensive and did not  fit like the  reviews said they should I got a size five and that usually works for me and it was two small and now I have to return them because they were expensive and it’s just so annoying so for the  hassle of having to wait for them now send them back I gave them a 3 star.
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 8 Shoe,B00SF6DKX0,R2OLGM3IM7RXI2,"November 27, 2019",1,Inferior Quality,"I ordered this shoe because I needed a flexible court shoe (because of previous foot surgery) to play Pickleball.  I have worn this shoe for the past 8 months only to play Pickleball once or twice a week (for a 2 hour timeframe) in an indoor court. As you can see in the pictures, the right shoe is separating from the sole in the toe area, and the left shoe is also beginning to separate in the same area. These shoes have had the least amount of wear of any shoes I own. Absolutely  inferior quality and construction."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 8 Shoe,B00SF6DKX0,R212JRVSHJHMUM,"November 26, 2019",5,Great shoe for high arches,Probably the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned.  I have high arches and have been having problems with my sneakers causing numbness in my toes because of the location of the laces. These have a lower profile and are comfortable all day with no issues. I do have one small complaint.  The soles are like little suction cups.  I work in an office with tile floors and I make a ton of noise walking down the halls.  It's annoying but not enough to make me change my shoes!
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 8 Shoe,B00SF6DKX0,R1EV2SKSQWZEUL,"September 7, 2019",1,Weird in the toes,"I usually wear a 7.5 but ordered up and got an 8. There’s a weird band that goes over the toe on the seam of the shoe which rubbed my toes. Very uncomfortable. I am returning because I think even an 8.5 would have the same issue with the band, plus they weren’t cushionie enough on the bottom anyways."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 8 Shoe,B00SF6DKX0,R2CTRVVU6IIVXI,"October 12, 2019",4,Very comfortable,"Love these shoes. They are very comfortable and great quality. I would definitely order a size up because the first time I ordered them, I got my actual size and they were too small. So I sent them back and got a size bigger and they are perfect. I think it’s because the whole top of the shoe is a stretchy fabric. The only thing I don’t like is that the tongue of the shoe is not held by the laces so it slips around sometimes."

I do workout a lot during the week, so I wear them 5-6 days a week, but I was sad to see them already falling apart. I will continue to wear them until they fall off because they are comfy & light, but I'm a bit disappointed."

However, after 3 uses the ""ball of the foot"" pad on the bottom of the shoe began to come off and I tripped on it. Upon further review the pad on the bottom was peeling off after its 4th use. I used gorilla glue to put it back but we will see how long that lasts. I am so disappointed because the shoe was perfect."

I really like these shoes for their lightweight and overall support. The Nike Air Zoom Vapor X are for me more  comfortable than the previous model Nike  Air Zoom Vapor 9.5. The updated fit system locked in my feet and provided some extra support. The new outsole pattern changed the traction and provided a different feel on the court, which I liked.

If you plan on ordering, order at least a size and a half bigger. If it doesn’t come in half sizes than two sizes bigger. I tried to exchange shoe size for a bigger size, the seller had extremely poor customer service and never got back to myself or amazon for that matter. My best suggestion is order from somewhere else or make sure you’re spot on about the size you’re ordering. Basically, as it stands I’m stuck with a shoe that doesn’t fit my toddler. Good luck!"
Nike,Kid's Tanjun Running Shoe,B00YFS73O4,R1HYPK7DGRVRCK,"December 11, 2019",1,waste of money or I got defective pair,I only buy nikes for my kid bc I like the way they fit and gives they great support to run and play. These nikes did NOT fit like normal Nike’s. They lasted about literally ONE week before they broke and the material started coming apart. I couldnt return them otherwise I would total waste of my money. I wanted grey so I could use for a boy and girl very very very disappointed especially when we live on a tight budget

I have hiking shoes for the roads and trails.  I needed something lighter than my hiking shoes.  They look great, and have support for you feet.  I wear an 8, I bought an 8, I cannot wear gym socks with these, they won't fit, I bought liner socks and that works. Super light for my travels which I also will love.  the only thing is that the tongue is high and tight on my foot, I take them off immediately after wearing.  I have high arches and that may be why,"

Probably my favorite style of Nikes I've ever owned! These are my second pair of the odysseys. I'm a college xc runner so Nike usually wouldn't be my first choice for a distance sneaker..however, as soon as i tried on my first pair of these, they fit and felt perfect! Its really hard to find a sneaker that I like (neutral distance). They took only one run to really break in. They are light, responsive and work really well for road runs and going up and down hills. Only downside about these shoes is that they wear out too quickly; my first pair lasted about 2 months (average 35-40 miles a week). I hope these last longer but i highly doubt they will (Nikes are notorious for wearing out fast :/ )"

I use it for walking and the traction is great - went 2.5 miles with the pups as soon as I got em, and could have gone another 2.5! I dont prefer to run in these, as  the support on the arch/metatarsal isn't as cushioned."

I noticed someone in my office wearing sold black Nike sneakers with slim ankle length pants and a sharp blouse, and I thought it looked so trendy and modern. So, I figured I would copy the style! These sneakers are pretty and fit good. I usually wear a size 9 in shoes, but I get 8 1/2 in running sneakers because there’s extra room in the toes for the runners. I don’t plan to run in these - just wear them during the day around town. They don’t have a very high arch, but I find them to be comfortable. I’m happy with the purchase!"

I bought these to wear all the time to work. I stand on my feet for the better part of 10 hours a day. These are NOT the shoes you want to wear to do that. The cushion is nonexistent after about 4 hours. The shoes are incredibly uncomfortable in my heels and cause me a great deal of pain. They're cute and comfortable for school when you're going to be sitting for long periods of time, but not much more than that."

I have the same style shoe in a light gray and was excited to find them in black.  Ordered same size only to find they were way too tight in toe box and width.  Ultimately exchanged them but had to pay more $ for a 1/2 size bigger.  They are a great neutral runner with cushion (which my knees appreciate).

When I received them, the shoes did not look real. The nike logo was falling off. They do not fit well. They are the very definition of a very narrow shoe. I wanted to return the shoes, but was told that I missed the return date by a day. I was given only 10% back of what the original price was. They are of no use to me. You cannot even wear the shoes for walking. They make your feet ache. THESE SHOES ARE AWFUL DO NOT BUY!!!!!!"

Two noticeable negative issues,"Positives: Fit is as expected... the shoe is very light in weight and the price was good.  Two noticeable negative issues... the first detractor is the shoe provides low stability, and therefore, I would not recommend if a customer requires lateral stability.  Secondly, the sole has a tendency to ""capture"" small rocks and pebbles within the tread groves... Tread groves are wide enough to allow you to clear debris easily, but it is annoying. Overall, I'm satisfied with the shoe."

Walking on cobblestone for 6 miles? Hiking volcanic terrains? Exploring the villages all day? No problem with Nike Free RN! Comfortable, stylish, and worth the money."
Nike,Free Rn Sense,B01K0NQJVU,R3O0Z9ZK3Z0MT,"May 25, 2017",5,Love!,"I bought these in preparation of a trip to Las Vegas, knowing I would be on my feet and walking around a lot (which I am not exactly used to doing these days, unfortunately). I was so happy I got them, and still am. Last time I went to Vegas my feet were killing me and it was so distracting, I really could not enjoy myself. This time I was armed with my Nikes and it made a huge difference! My feet felt just great; I could walk forever in these babies. Plus they are super freaking cute and I got lots of compliments (and they happen to match my hair, so bonus!). Highly recommend. I wear 8.5 to 9 (closer to 9 usually) and the 9's fit perfect. FYI, I am under a black light in the photo, so the colors in the pic are a bit exaggerated."
Nike,Free Rn Sense,B01K0NQJVU,R3SKA966LAWEEP,"July 18, 2018",4,2nd Favorite Pair,"I really like these shoes. They fit as expected, and give a lot of support. I only run 3 miles a day so I expect these to last a while, and so far they are holding up great. I have 4 pairs of running shoes, and these are my 2nd favorite (sorry Nike, I have a pair of UA that I like better). I would definitely recommend these. Update: While I enjoyed these for 3 mile runs, I no longer am wearing them as my miles increased. As I have become more and more aware of the pains of long distance running, I realize these do not have enough padding for me for long distances. I wouldn’t buy these again, though they are working fine for a walking shoe."

They fit true to size but I also wear very thin socks with these kind of tennis shoes so maybe with thicker socks someone might want to go up a half a size but for me they fit perfectly. Wore them for a few hours out and about and they were extremely comfortable the entire time. Definitely recommend these.

They’re very comfortable and air flows through them nicely, which keeps my feet from overheating. I’ve received numerous compliments on them. I don’t wear them to exercise so not sure how well they hold up with more rigorous wear. They’re mainly weekend errand shoes or when I know I’m going to be on my feet all day."
Nike,Free Rn Sense,B01K0NQJVU,R2ATYP7J8HFR6I,"June 16, 2018",5,light and comfortable,These are lightweight and comfortable shoes that have a wide toe box and provide mild arch support. You could use them for running but I prefer Hoka One Ones for running and hiking. I use the Nike Flex as my all-around casual shoe. I’m a size 8 ½ in some shoes but I’m definitely a 9 in these. I paid $62 for them which is a great deal and at that price I probably should have bought two pairs.

They are so tight in that area, I wouldn't even be able to wear socks. To go barefoot would only irritate the skin because of the inside seams. I was hoping I could exchange them for a wider shoe, but it appears ""D"" is the widest available. Bummer, these are nice shoes.."
Nike,Free Rn Sense,B01K0NQJVU,R178NFF9NCY0DE,"December 6, 2018",3,A dissapointment compared to my previous Flex shoes,"These shoes are lightweight but narrow (and unstable).  I used 2015 Flex shoes for many years and loved them for running inside and out, cardio, cross-training, even hiking etc.  These are wedged in the back narrow making them unstable.  They are also thin-soled so you feel every pebble and rock.  They are okay for running on tracks, smooth roads, or treadmills.  But not good for cross-training, running on gravel, hiking, etc. Also, I've been size 9 forever.  These are tight with toes feeling jammed against toe-box.  Bottom line, I put these on my shelf for limited use and went and bought another pair of a different brand."

I was worried that I might need to break them in to get them comfortable, and I received them the day I left to go and wore them on the first day of the convention. They were SOOO Comfortable!! I was walking about 20,000 steps a day for about 4/5 days. So worth the purchase and super cute!"
Nike,Free Rn Sense,B01K0NQJVU,R24ZT2MU9ZFG2D,"November 7, 2016",5,I use these shoes for walking on my treadmill. ...,"I use these shoes for walking on my treadmill.  I bought a half size larger for my feet as Nike has run a little narrower on my feet.  I have a wide foot, but these are more fabricy and have more give.  They fit as I expected them to buying a half size larger."
Nike,Free Rn Sense,B01K0NQJVU,RCD472MITMU52,"December 2, 2018",1,They appear used,"So..when I opened the box the shoes were placed upright not on their sides. The laces were untied/loosened up from the shoe eyelets as if someone had loosened the shoes to try them on or wear them. There was also no padding/paper in the shoes or the box also suggesting someone may have put them on at some point or worn them. Theres also a small bit of dirt on them. IDK, the shoes are okay I guess I just expected the grey shoe material to not be so flimsy and loose and to have some more support. Or at least packaged to look like they had not been used."
Nike,Free Rn Sense,B01K0NQJVU,R1CFQ2J0WF5X35,"January 19, 2018",5,Really lightweight and comfortable shoe. These are probably my favorite to wear ...,"Really lightweight and comfortable shoe. These are probably my favorite to wear if I'm running. More comfortable than the Nike Free IMO. I got the Glacier Blue thinking they would be a bit more grey, but they are blue shoes. So don't let the pic fool you. Not an issue, however. Still a really great, high quality product!"
Nike,Free Rn Sense,B01K0NQJVU,R1B87M638ARTUR,"November 3, 2018",2,Nike Disappointed Me this time,"I almost always find Nike shoes to be predictable. They almost always fit as expected, are well made, look good and last. This pair I was not happy with. I didn't understand exactly what ""minimal heel"" meant until I tried them on. Basically the heel is like the rest of the covering; entirely soft, no structure or support in the heel. This makes putting them on difficult as the heel collapses when you press your heel down. You need to really loosen the laces and use a shoe horn or your finger to keep the heel from collapsing.  This model just seemed much more cheaply made then all my previous Nikes. I returned them."
Nike,Free Rn Sense,B01K0NQJVU,R17BZCCCTGW4I5,"November 23, 2017",1,Not pleased that I spent 75 dollars to receive used shoes,So these shoes came clearly used and smelling of perfume or incense.  Not pleased that I spent 75 dollars to receive used shoes...... there's even a rock in the tread.  Did not even come in a Nike box.
Nike,Free Rn Sense,B01K0NQJVU,R4JC5X5RZ39RD,"September 24, 2019",4,Women’s Nike Free Rn my fav style shoe,"Pay very close attention once you add the shoe of your preference to the cart. The title shoes men’s but when i selected my shoe preferences and added to cart, the cart description said women’s. I decided I would change my elected shoe size from men’s to women’s and that was a good call. Not entirely sure if they’re (the style) is women’s or not but the size matches to what I wear in women’s shoes. I will say it may be a tad in the smaller side. It still fits me fine but my toes are closer to the top of the shoe than I usually choose. I worked out in them and they’re super comfortable which is why I love Nike Free Rns."

Also comfortable for daily casual wear and for walking everywhere. Got my normal size, fit as expected. Easy to clean with water hose and let air dry. Inner sole easy to remove and replace with gel insoles if necessary."

I am normally a solid 10, but they only had an 11 in stock. I just went for it thinking I could wear thick socks. I'm glad i went with the larger size, as these definitely run a bit on the smaller side. They are a bit snug in the toe box, but nothing bad. I can't overstate enough how comfortable these are. I have worn them nonstop for 2 weeks, on my feet all day and walking around , without any pain or soreness whatsoever. And I get compliments every time I wear them. Style up or down, these are the best."

I have a really high arch, so anything that is a slip on can be really hard to put and and wear. Because of the high instep it can also be really hard to wear after time as it puts pressure on the top of my foot cutting off circulation. These however, I have zero problems with this and are so amazing comfortable. The color is beautiful while being neutral. I wear them all the time and have quickly become my go to shoe. I collect Nike’s and these might be my favorite!"

The box that the shoes were shipped in was far too big for the shoe size. Not what I expected from my usual Nike boxes this was beat up and abnormal in size.  If I didn’t know any better I would say they were knock offs (replicas) I didn’t want to chance returning and not getting a pair at all as the NIke stores are and continue to be sold out.  The shoes fit well.

I have a rather flat foot, but just enough of an arch on these to fit comfortably. I wanted a shoe for some light running, lifting and anything in between.

I am getting back into running and thought I would give them a shot. If you want a shoe with a lot of support, this is not your shoe. If you want a basic running shoe that is lightweight and does the job, this is a good place to start. Also, it has a fixed tongue which is nice because it doesn’t bunch or pinch. Decent shoe doe the price."

I only wear them for about a year and rotate them around with several different pairs. This was the first pair I have bought that I hated. They are very good looking, but as far as coushion, and shock absorbency they suck! I couldn’t wait to take these off. Luckily it was only an 8 hour shift because my feet, legs, and back were killing me. I know some people are going to say, you have to break them in. But I have never had this issue with a pair of Nike’s before. I’m going to try them again, but take an extra pair of shoes with me to change into just in case I run into the same problem. If you are an avid runner, or like me you’re on your feet all day, don’t buy these. They are horrible!! And for $140 I expected a lot more."

This is my fourth pair and I can't say enough about how wonderful it is to be walking on air.

However the color best described, I put them on today and they fit perfectly..matched perfectly with the colors I normally wear, are very comfortable. Fit perfectly. I never dreamed I would spend so much on a tennis shoe and be so very happy. I now know why so many people opt to pay the price for Nike's.

I always felt a little off-balance and light in the feet. So I researched good cross-fit/HIIT workout shoes and these came up in the top 3. I don't usually wear Nike because they seem to run small and tight, even on my slightly narrow foot, and I like to wear my running shoes on the looser end. But these have a nice wide toe box that is just right. The rest of the shoe does run a little narrow, and is kind of flat in the arch, but it's exactly what I need for my HIIT training. Totally worth the cost!"

Nike,Women's Metcon 4 XD Training Shoe,B07HDS9CX5,R11I3TO7NXBQUA,"October 12, 2019",3,No cushion...,The shoe is really hard.  No cushion.
Nike,Women's Metcon 4 XD Training Shoe,B07HDS9CX5,R1XLVURFKAL3DT,"October 1, 2019",4,Great for lifting,"These shoes are my go to weight lifting shoes. Great fit, comfortable, breathable, and sooo cute! I didn’t exactly enjoy doing cardio with them, though."
Nike,Women's Metcon 4 XD Training Shoe,B07HDS9CX5,R1A1YM5KV1VBF9,"September 6, 2019",3,Overpriced,The tongue is very long and thin RUBBER which makes the shoes look cheap.  Not worth the money
Nike,Women's Metcon 4 XD Training Shoe,B07HDS9CX5,R2F37SLK83Z93U,"January 23, 2020",5,Snug shoe that doesn’t hurt!,This was my first pair of “lifting” shoes. They fit snug but don’t hurt my feet (women’s size 9.5 and wide) The grip on the bottom of the shoe really does help when doing complex barbell movements or walking lunges.
Nike,Women's Metcon 4 XD Training Shoe,B07HDS9CX5,R2O4GV62C6I7ZM,"February 12, 2020",5,Great workout shoe,My trainer at the gym recommended this shoe for my gym workouts.  I was originally wearing my running shoes.  These are so comfortable and more stable for weight training.  Very lightweight and they look cute too.
Nike,Women's Metcon 4 XD Training Shoe,B07HDS9CX5,RHAV2Z1GLL135,"December 21, 2019",4,Good shoe for what they are designed for,I don’t like how expensive they are. But they are quieter then the old metcons and way more comfortable. Great for Crossfit workouts bad for running in.
Nike,Women's Metcon 4 XD Training Shoe,B07HDS9CX5,R2GEN44OHIHM0B,"January 15, 2020",5,Love Metcons.,Love the Metcons. I typically wear a 6 in street shoes and 6.5 in athletic shoes. Fits as expected. Very comfortable for running and jumping yet stable for lifting. My favorites.
Nike,Women's Metcon 4 XD Training Shoe,B07HDS9CX5,R2K2MC72NSHWO1,"July 27, 2019",5,Great for CrossFit!,As described!

Nike,Women's Metcon 4 XD Training Shoe,B07HDS9CX5,R2MMFGQK9T7ZUH,"July 21, 2019",1,Wouldn’t recommend,Very uncomfortable
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R2QMGNYPMWIZE,"July 22, 2018",1,They came apart after barely wearing them for 3 days!,I’ve only had this sandal for one week but didn’t take it out the box until three days ago. Only had the chance to wear it to one place in public (a restaurant) where I did nothing but sat in a chair the majority of the time. The sandal is coming undone on the side which you can see it was glued. I’m upset being that I really didn’t have the chance to wear them. I even ordered a full size up because I wanted extra room. Was so excited when I ordered these and now I’m super disappointed. A waste of money.
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R98EVZ1YNMGE1,"April 6, 2018",5,worlds most functional shoe,"I caved in and bought these sandals. Don't get me wrong, they aren't the prettiest but boy are they functional. No longer do you have to take of your socks when taking your dog to the bathroom to put on a pair of flip flops. Wear them with socks or dont, they are amazingly comfortable and so functional."
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R3HYE7RD6GMED8,"February 10, 2018",4,Runs ridiculously small and i suggest not using in shower/water,"I washed my feet in the shower with these slides on, and when i went to dry my feet and wore the slides, the band was very wet and felt uncomfortable so i had to switch to my Primark pool slides until they dried. Now i use the Primark slides for the showers and i use the Nike ones in my dorm or outside if i want to. These slides also run really small for some reason, so I suggest maybe ordering a size up and if you want a lot of room, maybe even a size and a half?"
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,RI0KJ4NH484N1,"January 6, 2018",5,Really nice.,"These are soft and comfortable.  Bought for my sister and plan on purchasing for myself. As far as some saying they were tight, I thought the same at first but after walking in them for just a few minutes they felt fine."
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R9IGSAM1832MG,"April 9, 2018",3,Right,"They are so cute I like the better than picture n lighter, however I guess I did not notice they weren't Velcro/adjustable across the foot and it is quite tight/small for the size. I usually wear a 8 1/2 I ordered a 9.. other than that shipping was pretty quick n packed well. Update : upon inspection after second time werlaring (I only wear around the house an hour at a time hoping to loosen a little) I see that the colored rubber in rubbed off in spots,like the dollar store flops and a seem that isn't where it was tight is coming apart. This is Nike? Used to mean quality..I guess that's why only cost what they did right"
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R368NS4ZOZO8D0,"December 31, 2019",3,"Not overly comfy, but okay. Quality seems okay.","I have tender feet so the textured foot bed hurt my feet a little at first but I got used to it within a few days. The part that goes across my foot is a little stiff and hurts across my foot if I stoop down to do something. It’s kind of hard to explain. It may just be my thin bony feet. Overall, pretty nice quality. Got wise... I usually wear a 9 but I probably could have gotten 9 1/2 in these. So, I’d say they run just slightly small."
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R1R29K6UXBRZ48,"November 5, 2019",5,Comfy good price!,Exactly what I wanted my only wish was that the fabric on the inside top of the strap was made of something other than idk fabric because it seemed to get sweaty easily from being in them a couple hours I used them as my house shoes because I hate being barefoot but the reason behind having it be fabric was to not hurt your foot so that was more important I guess I just shouldn’t of worn them all day long lol but I love them I’ve had them for a few months now great sandal.
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R1W8J52V2PT2N1,"July 8, 2017",5,Favorite summer slides,"Very comfy, though the band is snug for the first few wears. I would recommend wearing them around the house while wearing thick socks before wearing them without.  They were broken-in in no time, though, as they have quickly become summer standards. The chevron in both black and blue are very cute in person."
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R28K9W5C3Q6GZN,"July 11, 2018",5,Five Stars,Love!!! Perfect fit. Soft and cute!
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R2BWOG8NZ4D18L,"April 22, 2018",1,"Fit tight and big, poorly packed shipping",Received this and the boxed was crushed. The shoes are tight in one way and too big in another. I have had Nike slides before and never have they been this tight across the top and it fits like a 9 along the sole. I wouldn’t buy these again without trying on.
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R3EZ1VH20MZISH,"June 29, 2017",5,Great Shoes. Right on the money.,My daughter was extremely happy. She says they are comfortable. They look good on her too. Great for= after a long workout or just lounging.
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R1XMFI2QXBY7P7,"September 12, 2019",5,Happy Feet,I went to buy these shoes at DSW and they didn't have my size and I needed them by Friday (this was on Wednesday) so I went out to my car and found them on Amazon I ordered them and they were delivered the next afternoon! I wear an 8 I ordered an 8 and they fit perfectly.  They are so very comfortable love how cushioned they are!
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R2GCBUINLI28O2,"January 15, 2017",3,Three Stars,They look Different from the picture. It says nike and the swoosh!
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,RWK0I3J3ZUZLG,"November 15, 2019",2,Way too tight,The strap is way too tight across the top of your foot. I don’t have a big/“chubby” foot and yet it still felt like it was cutting off circulation from my toes - just after a few minutes. I had to return.
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R2YA533T9SXYI6,"November 27, 2019",5,LOVE the LOOK and FEEL of these sandals!,"My daughter had a pair, so I ordered some too.  We both have narrow feet, and this sandal fit us well!  I like the simplicity of the design, and the price was right!"
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,RGE4QV3BHWPYZ,"October 15, 2017",2,They're just okay,I wear a size 10 but these seem to be a half size too small and they're tight across the top of my foot. I really don't like the ridges on the foot bed either; they're uncomfortable. Too bad I threw away all of the packaging otherwise I'd send them back.
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R3D7MT47KJEB2V,"May 23, 2018",3,Comfy,They're a little snug but once they're broken in pretty comfy. Might not be comfy if you have bunions but they have nice arch support and cushion. I've had them for several months now but the seam is starting to come apart on one of the sides. I'm still wearing them and will try to fix. I don't think I wear them harshly as I only wear them around the house and only outside to take it the trash.
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,RTW13QVGEAVV,"July 13, 2018",2,Uncomfortable on top of foot.,"I do like the design, but the fit cuts into my upper foot.  I returned it for a larger, but that fit was uncomfortable also.  Finally found a similar sandal called Under Armour."
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R394EY7RLFRZYT,"December 16, 2018",3,Nice sandal...Not for narrow feet.,I bought the same shoe at Shoe Show prior to this purchase. I really like this color and was happy I found it on Amazon a great deal. Sadly this sandal was an entirely different fit. I have narrow feet. My foot completely slipped through this shoe.
Nike,Women's Kawa Slide Sandal,B005RFGSB8,R36KC62CIIPBT5,"January 10, 2020",1,Save your money,Slide runs small and company does not tell you and they do not provide quality customer service on fixing the issue of the slides not fitting
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,R1DKS9V47L8ULF,"March 7, 2017",5,Most comfortable shoe I've ever owned,"Great sneaker. Very comfortable, lightweight and great for being on your feet all day. Practically feels like you're just wearing socks on the top and sides of your foot and the foam in the sole is very supportive and cushy. Looks even better when you're wearing them than it does without a foot inside in the product photos. I bought a pair for myself for an all day, early morning to late evening event which required me to walk and stand the entire day, and amazingly, my feet didn't hurt at all at the end of the day or the next day. They're now my everyday shoe and they're so comfy that I bought this pair in a different colorway for my boyfriend who is on his feet all day at work."
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,R2YMYIBBSW61IA,"July 26, 2017",5,Most comfortable shoe EVER.,"Have gout and a somewhat flat foot.  I also do not like when my toe jams into the rubber part of the front of all other shoes I have.  I have really nice Asics Gel Kayanos and would have sworn they were the most comfortable shoes.  The only issue is the support around the front sometimes cramps my toes in.  When I put these Nike Tanjuns on, I discovered the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn.  The entire front of the shoe is loose fabric and the sole is a flat memory foam material.  Feels like I am wearing a super comfortable sock.  I have now purchased 5 pairs of these shoes in different colors.  I am the type of person who will buy as many of something as I can if I am worried the style or feel will change in the future. That being said, I will wear my Asics for extreme sporting activities and the Tanjuns for everything else."
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,RAINTA1I7SJYS,"August 30, 2017",5,Perfect Sneakers!,"I have purchased many pairs of sneakers over the years, but the Nike Tanjun Running Sneaker literally has been the only pair I've owned that has checked all the boxes. They are light weight, super comfortable, stylish, durable, and fit perfectly. I have worn them almost daily for months now and they still look as good as the day I bought them. I highly recommend these sneakers!"
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,R1DW7WHW2O34TQ,"August 12, 2018",4,Recommended.  Already on my second pair...,"I'm not a prolific shoe shopper.  I value shopping convenience over variety, and comfort over style. I purchased a pair of this style (but a different color combination) previously.  That pair worked out well, so I figured it would be safe to re-order. I primarily wear the shoes to work, though I also wear them for basketball and to work out.  The shoe length is accurate, to my foot.  The width is a bit on the narrow side, but the upper is just mesh so it fits ok.  The arch support is a little lacking, but I can still comfortably stand in the shoes for a few hours at a time.  Work duty and the elliptical are fine with the shoes, but basketball is not as good (mostly due to a lack of lateral stability). The most notable feature of the shoe is the entirely mesh upper.  As you might imagine, the shoes are terrible in the rain.  They can also be a bit breezy in the cold, but they're great in hot conditions.  My feet are noticeably cooler in these shoes (than other cross training/tennis shoes)."
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,R288QG0P25WP48,"August 15, 2018",1,Not cushioned. Very hard outsole.,"I've done and am still doing research on shoes. I have plantar fasciitis and need a cushioned shoe. This is definitely not it. I'm not sure what's going on with the reviews and/or the claims by the company, but these shoes have a cheap 2mm foam insert on top of an extremely hard outsole. This thing does not give at all. I tried these shoes on for 15 minutes and couldn't stand the pain. These may be great for stability, I don't know. They're definitely not comfortable or cushioned at all."
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,R2UNNJK6KWJCQG,"January 6, 2018",5,Comfortable and lightweight,I work 80 hours a week. I am going to put these shoes to the test. This is my second pair and I must say these shoes can take a beating. I have foot problems but these shoes help with the pain. I stay on my feet all day and I recommend them Comfortable and lightweight.
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,R1QZA4KJELQILA,"August 6, 2016",5,Great sneakers so far,Extremely lightweight and breathable sneakers.  Very comfortable. They do need to be broken in by wear but that doesn't take long at all.  Size ran normal for me also.  Great sneakers.
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,R2AZ9XF9F88PF5,"April 11, 2018",5,Nice shoes.,Really comfortable. Lightweight too. Really nothing wrong with them from what i can tell
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,R356Z5I441C6OJ,"August 9, 2019",2,DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE PRICE! POOR DESIGN!!,"I’m conflicted over these shoes. They look nice and they fit my 13 year old well (size 7.5) but the toe and top of foot area has no support at all. It’s just a thin material with the netting on top so these are good for light wear like school or leisurely walking but not for anything more than that as they won’t protect that area at all if something falls on it. Of course they’re not supposed to be steel toe quality but this is the thinnest I’ve ever seen in an athletic shoe for any of my family and this is Nike. I would expect better quality than this. Also, whoever designed this paper thin butterfly wing tongue design WITH breathable basketball short type holes throughout the whole middle needs to be fired. It’s terrible. It’s too hard to pull up and keep in place with your hand while trying to hold onto the back of the shoe to slip onto your foot. And like I said, it’s paper thin so I suspect it will rip in the weaker side areas way before the rest of the shoe wears out which in turn, will render the shoes completely useless and unwearable. He says he will keep them because he likes the color and fit but I really feel like I will have to be replacing them within a few months whereas his usual Nike that I buy lasts him a complete school year. Not worth the $60 price tag on them at all!  Not even close!! Shop for a different shoe!"
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,RSY4C143DAVCC,"April 15, 2019",1,Wore through the tread in 3 weeks,"These shoes do not hold up, I wore through the tread in 3 weeks.  The cushion has broken down and they are uncomfortable to walk in now.  If you walk on a wet surface use caution."
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,R35X3000OXUWI9,"November 3, 2017",5,These are nice shoes! I will say from past experience,"These are nice shoes! I will say from past experience, that Nike shoe sizes do run small. I normally wear a 10 1/2, but with Nike I wear an 11 1/2. I bought 11 1/2 and they fit perfectly and they are very comfortable. Hard to find basic black and white shoes anymore. Everything is either neon orange or some other crazy color. I do recommend these shoes though. Just be carefull about the size you order."
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,RT5KR56XC9LSN,"October 27, 2017",5,"Not bad looking shoe, but narrow","These were kind of narrow and hurt my feet until like the 6th time I wore them...  Then again I have wide feet, so that could be part of the issue. Also the toe started separating from the front of the shoe like the 4th time I wore them,, so I was not happy about that.. Bought nikes before in the past, and never had the issue. Love the all black tho!!"
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,RS6ST436K3FEN,"June 11, 2019",2,This is a fashion shoe not a walking shoe,"When I first put these on they were a bit tight but figured they'd stretch a bit.  They did not, while they were ok in the toe area, the width was very snug.  My main issue with the shoe was that for all the apparent cushioning, there is actually very little once you put them on.  It is a very, very firm shoe with little to no arch support, I could feel myself standing on my heals. The mesh of the upper is very nice and does ventilate well.  If you will be doing a reasonable amount of standing or walking, these are not the shoes to wear.  I wear a standard width size 10 for the last 30+ years, these are on the snug side."
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,R1IE37Q7TP9DQP,"June 14, 2018",5,"I’m flat footed, and these are the softest, most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever owned!","I have flat feet, and finding a comfortable walking/running shoe is extremely difficult.  My job requires a LOT of walking several hours a day, and these feel like I’m wearing socks!  Incredibly soft and comfortable, and I can walk all day in my flat feet.  I was so impressed with these that after just 3 days I ordered another pair in a different color. If you have flat feet like me, you will absolutely LOVE these!"
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,R3PJ314UHTZPUZ,"November 4, 2018",5,Fits well,"Got as a gift for my husband. They fit him well, and I got the all black ones. They show dirt pretty easily, but I can throw the entire pair in the washer and clean them in no time. I have a pair of women’s tanjuns and had to get him his own. They’re comfy and breathable and good for working and standing in all day. The arch keeps my feet from hurting as bad at the end and of the day. My husband said they have a little bit of foam on the inside, however, and mine didn’t not. I bought them specifically because they aren’t memory foam, as every shoe nowadays is, and my husbands feet grind the foam down to the rubber. Hopefully these will hold up better than all the other ones with foam on the inside, but I wish it wasn’t There."
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,R2V6N84G44C5OS,"June 6, 2018",5,Favorite Sneaker of All Time,"If you need to get new tennis shoes I can not recommend this pair enough. They are my favorite sneaker of all time. I'm seriously debating if I should get another 'back up' pair in case Nike stops making them down the road so I will have another pair when I wear these out. I got them bc I have to start wearing some custom orthotics daily due to collapsed arches and  I liked these b/c you can 'dress' them up a little bit for sneakers. But they are so light, breathable and like walking on a very supportive cloud if that makes sense. The mesh is flexible so it will accommodate bunions too if you have them (they stretch out for my orthotics nicely). I show up for happy hours in them and ppl say outfits are 'cute' so they really do the dress up role nicely.  I'm so happy with them. I got a men's size - I'm a 9 in women's and  ordered an 8 men's and they fit perfect."
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,RPMX94IWHYZDH,"April 8, 2019",4,A Year Later,"I’ve been wearing these shoes very regularly for about 14 months. Here’s the short: Pros: These are pretty comfortable and good if you’re on your feet all day and want shoes that can assist in delaying heel pain. Cons: The tread is GONE. I’ve found myself slipping and sliding for a few months to the point that it’s time to retire these permanently. I’d keep wearing if the tread lasted longer, but it just hasn’t help up even to relatively light use after one year. Conclusion: Worth it, but look for a sale, because they probably won’t last as long as you’d like."
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,RFJU78N901B8Z,"November 17, 2018",5,Fits the bill,"I actually had to return these. They were a present for my dad but ran just a little too small. Amazon didn't have the correct size so I ended up ordering them from famous footwear. That said, I got these for my dad because my bf has the same ones and LOVES them. My dads replacement shoes came in the mail and he loves these as well. They're light and comfortable and look decent. I would 100% recommend them, but possibly order the half size up."
Nike,"Men's Tanjun Sneakers, Breathable Textile Uppers and Comfortable Lightweight Cushioning",B077YZQQH9,R3KQIL7VQ3BL5F,"August 22, 2018",5,These shoes are the most comfortable shoes ever and they fit perfectly,"I am a Male 5ft 10in weighing 344lbs and i bought these shoes to start working out in, and after 3 months i must say i am overly impressed. These shoes are the most comfortable shoes ever and they fit perfectly, I absolutely love them!!!!!!!!! I bought the all black and they are look really cool as well for you sneaker heads who wanna stay fly without over spending. Just two small things to note, after a while the side soles start to crease i guess due to constant impact (feet hitting ground through walking, running etc), i chalked that up to my weight as i am quiet heavy and with respect to the colour i bought, they tend to need cleaning often as the smallest amount of dust and dirt can make them look very old and worn. All in all i am happy with my purchase and will look to buy again if needed"
Nike,Women's Free Metcon 2 Training Shoe,B07HDSKBFM,R24460QTSIU1PB,"July 24, 2019",4,Love these shoes!,"These shoes are absolutely perfect for my CrossFit workouts.  They're great for lifting, there is just enough edge on the heel that they fit nicely in the rower, the arch support is great and not overly stiff.  I will definitely order more of these."
Nike,Women's Free Metcon 2 Training Shoe,B07HDSKBFM,R21UZJ4IZU6Z2F,"December 4, 2019",5,Like little clouds,I love my metcons! These are so comfortable with enough support. Honestly they are like walking on clouds. Great for everyday wear or cross training.
Nike,Women's Free Metcon 2 Training Shoe,B07HDSKBFM,RB0GNK3ZKPR87,"February 1, 2020",4,"Super cute, Sturdy, Comfy- GREAT BUY","Disclaimer: I have not worked out in these yet, but I Will tomorrow! So far i took away 1 star because the shoes arrived in a damaged/used-looking shoebox and was wrapped in tattered/used insert paper. These shoes clearly were not brand spankin-new. I inspected them and they don’t appear to have been worn, but they were definitely purchased and returned. Overall poor first impression. In terms of the shoes themselves: 1) There are a few minor defects in the appearance of the shoes. A few random frayed threads & minor discoloration. 2) I ordered my regular size (10 women’s) and these shoes fit perfectly everywhere. Perfect around my ankle, on the sides of my feet, and on the toe box (just wide enough to not squish the toes, but narrow enough to feel secure. This was my gripe with the No Bull trainers. The toe box just felt way too big and wide). 3) i did a few exercises in them on carpet & hardwood in my house: burpees, knee highs, squats, lunges, step ups, and jumping split squats. Every move felt so supported!! They are flat and sturdy like I like, but flexible enough to do jumping and cardio moves. I can’t wait to do leg day in these shoes tomorrow!"

Nike,Women's Free Metcon 2 Training Shoe,B07HDSKBFM,R2CW8PMBCOA705,"December 5, 2019",3,Shoe is uncomfortable,The shoe seemed great at first but the top of the shoe is very uncomfortable. I have small but wide feet so I always have to order 7.5 in athletics shoes. The top of the shoe pushed down on the top of my foot and created indents in the skin through my sock. There is no loosening that area. It’s an elastic closure. A lot of the newer shoes have this style and I have yet to find a replacement for my original Nike’s. I think the shoe can be a great product if your feet aren’t wide.

For the price I expect to have a comfortable shoe. They are so uncomfortable that in the time it took to try them on and walk around I started getting cramps in the arches of both of my feet. They look nice but that’s about it. Also I never buy from third party vendors because returns are not as easy but in this case I did. Well I ended up just keeping them and leaving them in the closet till my kid can wear them or something."

The second day my foot pain was gone. Now, I feel much comfortable with it. I wish I had come across it earlier!"

Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,RXDWNQZH7AME1,"February 19, 2018",5,These shoes are the PERFECT accessory to jump start a new life ladies,"These shoes are the PERFECT accessory to jump start a new life ladies! Two months ago my dream man just packed up and left our home one day while I was at work, without notice. I stopped living briefly. Just when I did not think I could feel any worse, I started to look for any sign of life on his social media accounts with his thousands of followers. Low and behold...there he was...liking, commenting and interacting with hundreds of skanks. Very odd I thought as it's a business site meant solely for selling clothing and art/photographs. Here we are, two months later and not a word even though we drive by each other every day in this horrible oilfield town. I finally pulled it together, thought things through and realized that I never TRULY loved myself! In essence I sank my own damn ship. What a profound moment that was! Although I'm embarking on a lengthy and life changing journey of learning what this means and how to adore myself, I knew that Amazon was always standing by to pick up the pieces. So after more time I found a shred of strength and ordered these shoes. Hell, I didn't even have the extra money to do so but I did it anyway. After all, I was envisioning my new and vibrant life. I figured now was as good as a time as any to take a page out of his book and start running away from things! Today, after I saw the UPS guy punt the box from the curb (fairly impressive), I felt a sense of relief as I went to retrieve them from the snow drift he had inadvertently buried them in. I opened the package and slipped them on and they were a dream!  Light as a feather and a perfect fit (order at least a half size larger than your own size).  So different, so unique!  Not your average running shoe. And off to the recreation center I went. Just me, these amazing and magical feeling shoes, 13 different emotions, and the prophetic poetry of Eminem pushing me around on that indoor track, ""Success is my only mother****ing option, failure's not."" So if you're looking for your moment...your do-over...your time to sparkle...your victory song...these shoes should DEFINITELY be part of your arsenal! Let them be symbolic in finding yourself again...you won't regret the purchase!"
Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,R14J7PZP6VKSXT,"December 13, 2019",5,The best insoles,"I decided to change my previous insole, due to some bad smells on my feet. I did some homework and found out that sport insole are the best, as they have breathable features. So i decided buying one, I received my order of ""GOAG INSOLES"", As soon as I received them I put them into my work boots. I couldn't believe how great my feet felt. They provide so much comfort and really support my foot during the long work day. They also didn't slip in my shoes and kept the odor in check after the end of the day. I normally have lower back pain from being on my feet for most of the day and I can already feel a difference with only using the insoles for a few days. So glad I found something to not only keep my foot comfortable but also helps with my back. **This insole are very light weight. ** They are easy to cut and fit your own size. ** i also figured out that we can hand wash this insole, when they are too dirty. ** The arc support is an additional feature to give extra comfort to your feet."

Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,R2957A5ADU2H3Z,"February 28, 2017",5,Best workout shoes I've every owned,"I'm writing this review after two months of use as my standard workout footgear. This is a very light, well made shoe.  The soles are very supportive, responsive, & flexible while providing comfortable arch support.  The knit body breathes exceptionally well & makes wearing these shoes w/o any socks very comfortable & w/o causing your feet to sweat or stink.  The deep cutout around the ankle & the high padded fabric around the Achilles tendon eliminates rubbing, chaffing, & blisters.  The insoles are removable & washable which is a nice feature.  Wearing this shoe is almost like wearing a comfortable sock w/ a sole. One caveat - - if you have wide feet, these shoes can be a little tight across the top of your foot.  You may need to size up, or at least open the lacing up a good bit."
Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,R3PSMPEB642CRN,"December 31, 2018",5,Nice replacement insole,"I have a pair of Clark oxfords that still look good but have lost much of the heal cushioning.  I decided to give these insoles a shot and I am happy with the results.  With a bit of trimming, they have added new life and comfort to my shoes.  I removed the old insoles to make these fit and, as a replacement, they are even more comfortable than the originals. There are two things worth noting.  First, these insoles are wide where the ball of the foot rests.  If you try to put these into narrow shoes, there will be quite a bit of free hand trimming to do.  Even with regular D width shoes, I had to cut the sides down more that the cutting guide indicated.  Second, they will add darn near 1/2"" of height inside your shoe in the heal area (just like the descripton notes).  So, If you don't plan to remove the current insole, or the current insole in not removeable keep in mind it mighrt be a tight fit."
Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,RLKBGLC7BTUVO,"January 28, 2019",5,Comfortable and easy to modify,"These were easy to modify to my shoe size by cutting along the lines marked for each shoe size.  I found them comfortable.  However, your shoes have to be flexible on the top or have extra room.  Mine actually chafed the back of my feet since there wasn't enough room for my feet with this insert..and the shoe wasn't flexible.  I don't want to take off stars since this isn't the product's fault.. but it is something to be aware of."
Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,R39SWM1DQ5CY0S,"January 17, 2019",5,Very comfortable,"I walk 7 miles a day so shock absorption in my shoes is essential. Also, I've found I can make a pair of walking shoes last longer using inserts.  These do the trick, adding extra shock absorption to my shoes and making the insoles last longer. I love them."
Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,R15JLO7AV3JK69,"January 5, 2019",5,Great arch support,My son tends to pronate and he had just bought a pair of boots.  We put these in the boots and he could feel a big difference.  He said that it made the boots more comfortable and that his feet felt a bit more supported--success!  I would recommend these to others since they worked so well for my son.
Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,R29DWKJ68CEIX3,"March 28, 2018",4,Order up a full size!,"Awesome shoes, I’m a big fan of Nike frees. I will say they fit about one full size small. I read a review that said they run a little small, (I usually wear a 10.5 with Nike shoes) so I went half a size up to 11... the verdict... still a little too tight. It’ll be fine once I break them in a bit, or at least that’s what I’m hoping for. All in all, these are awesome looking shoes and the material is very light and breathable."

I love the Nike Flyknit series and they have served me well! Super comfy, easy to move in, and more fun than other options. Highly recommend. I will continue to purchase as long as they are available."
Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,RMOIAMUL0NL9K,"April 13, 2018",5,Works brilliantly as an everyday running shoe for me,"I've owned iterations of this style of running shoe since 2007.  It's had its ups and downs over the years, but I am very satisfied with this edition so far.  I've only put a handful of miles on them, but they are the right blend of stability and lightness that I love about these shoes.  For me it's true to size.  These feel a bit more snug on the tops than others, but not overly so.  The laces are thick, angular variety, which I've found to hold better.  What else can I say?  I've tried other brand, other styles (Pegasus), but in the end they always seem to give me knee trouble.  These things take all that away leaving me to focus on running."
Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,R30FPIAK38TGO4,"March 4, 2018",5,Walking on clouds...,"These are the most comfortable Nike shoes (and possibly just shoes) in existence! I’ve been wearing Nike Free for about 7 years and they have been my work shoes as a server/waitress, running shoes, and stylish street shoes. I recently bought a pair of flyknits for my boyfriend, who has been a chef for 15 years. The first day he wore them he told me it was the first night in at least a decade that his feet felt wonderful after a busy dinner shift. Life changers!"

Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,RCLL0M38WRWLS,"August 1, 2018",5,Great for traveling,"I'm generally not a Nike fan, much prefer Brooks for running, then Asics, then New Balance. However, these shoes are perfect for the traveler. Often on a day or two trip, sometimes three days, I'll only travel with my backpack. The biggest problem with that is packing workout gear and specifically the shoes. These pack very flat, as the heel can be bent over without damaging the shoe. Fantastic! I know New Balance has the Minimus, and there are other 'barefoot' type shoes out there, but these were the best at the right price. Fit like a glove, great with or without socks. I'm not doing long miles anymore, and wouldn't really do it in these anyway, but for the short runs of <5 miles seem very, very good."
Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,RDPR9MU5XRFIG,"May 8, 2018",1,THESE ARE CHEAP KNOCKOFFS!,I've had at least 10 pair of Nike free shoes in the past... RN flyknits too but these don't feel the same for some reason. The quality feels decent but the fit is much different than your normal frees or flyknits. Coming back to this after a month. As I'm scrolling for another pair saw these again. Definitely knockoffs. They are not original nike flyknits. Frees and flyknits are the only shoes I can wear comfortably and these hurt beyond. Don't buy them.
Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,R1RZEHT1J8JAP9,"June 22, 2018",5,Best running shoes ive ever had.,"OUTSTANDING shoes.  First time buying nike.  If youre looking for a high quality/lightweight feel, this is it.  Worth every penny in my opinion. Tip: These definitely work your soleus muscle more than your gastrocnemius, and I certainly over did it with these at first and as a result had some running injuries.  If youre not accustomed to barefoot/minimal running, train in these gradually.  I should have cycled them in with my normal asics to avoid injuries.  Just a heads up.  Lastly, they DO deliver more impact to your knees and force you to run more on the balls of your feet.  Not sure if these would be ideal for flatfooted runners. I heard some other runners complaining that the strap in the back rubbed against the achilles and caused irritation.  I personally experienced none of that. Also i heard the material isnt as nice as previous years, i see no issues and think its just fine. Note: i wear socks.  if you plan ongoing barefoot they seem upto the task, but i definitely noticed some ""sliding"" around of my foot when breaking these in.  That might be worse barefoot.  Plus with socks there is ZERO smell to these shoes which is a plus.  IMO thin running socks are ideal for these. Aside from that, these are the best shoes ive ever owned and i wouldve paid $150 for them if i had to!"
Nike,Women's Free Rn Flyknit Running Shoe,B0763R6P1D,R1IWB5RE94BREN,"September 29, 2017",5,Awesome Shoes but Not Great for Wide Feet,"These are my first pair of flyknit frees and I've only ever worn them for walking around at work. I have pretty wide feet and these don't fit perfectly, my pinkie toe slightly pokes out, but the flyknit is pliable enough that it's not uncomfortable. The length is perfect, and had I sized up I think the width would've worked, but the length too long. I'm used to wearing pretty flat shoes and have previously worn Nike Free 7.0s, the sole on these are a little high and took some getting used to (I had a few near face-plants from tripping on my own shoes... but this could probably attested to my own clumsiness). I like heel cupping, and know these are intended to be worn sockless, but I still wear these with ankle socks. Overall, I would recommend these shoes. It was a great price on Amazon, and they're cute and comfy right out of the box."

They are a little difficult to get on, but once they are on, they’re very comfortable and make your foot look smaller, which is nice. After having a baby, it’s hard to find shoes that are comfortable and look cute. These are great for running around after my now toddler."

I never had a bad experience until this purchase. Just a few weeks in, and these had a horrible smell. My daughter has never had an issue with shoes smelling before these. No matter what I do to clean/freshen them, the odor is horrible. I can’t let her wear anymore. Sad because she loved this show."

They are comfy and I’m getting them warn in to stretch out a bit but I love them! Super cute and comfy!!
Nike,"Women's Low-Top Sneakers Running Shoes, Black, 9.5 us",B017CK6I3S,RA3O1BBQZV34H,"April 17, 2019",2,THEY ARE SMALL!,These shoes look great. The issue is the size. I ordered a 7.5 for my wife which is her size. A 7.5 arrived but it was more like a 4.5 child’s shoe! I’ve never seen sizing so off I’m my life. It was laughable how small they are. I returned them & got my money refunded a month later

UK 4 US 6. The toe box is very short and small. I have very small narrow feet and even these feel like they are a size too small. I would reccomend half or full sizing up. They have held up fairly well but are definitely uncomfortable due to the short toe box.

I buy 2pair of ever color!  I love them!  I have an ankle issue and with the top band of elastic it supports the ankle just  great!  Always great great compliments on them!!  I did go up a size for a shoe insert or winter sock.  Wore them in 100 degree weather, found they were not hot or uncomfortable.  They feel like a slipper!"

She never really considered buying sneakers for herself. Not in the past 6 or 7 years, anyway. So, I bought her 2 pairs of the Nike React Element 55, and she IMMEDIATELY fell in love with them! Before she even tried them on, she was raving about the style and the unique colorways!!! But then she put them on and she was even more blown away! She couldn't stop talking about these shoes! Also, she loves the fact that everyone comments on them when she wears them out and about... She gets compliments all of the time about her shoes. Theses are a definite MUST BUY for both Women's and Men's sneakers!"

Nike,Women's React Element 55 Running Shoes,B07N3YWYJZ,R2GHDVRSFF1WMB,"February 12, 2020",4,Great shoes... but slippery!,These shoes look great -- I just don't know how they are considered to be running shoes or gym shoes. My feet fit perfectly but tend to slip around. I've even tried using different socks and it still makes me feel uncomfortable when I'm working out. Having an unsteady shoe while running or lifting weights is NOT GOOD. Also -- the back part cut through my ankles. You have to literally pull your ankle socks UP. I regret this purchase. Thankful it wasn't  too expensive.

Nike,Women's React Element 55 Running Shoes,B07N3YWYJZ,R2QOXD3DJWLYHE,"January 2, 2020",3,Not as expected,Runs small so go a half to full size up Also even while wearing socks you can see the shape of your toes through the fabric

And we cannot return them because Amazon’s return window is only four weeks.  Don’t spend the money for a terribly made shoe.  We are truly disappointed in Nike and will not buy another pair.

Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R2RVZFZAVUZG95,"July 12, 2017",4,Knock off? Where's the removeable insole Nike Swoosh symbol?,"I needed a shoe for postnatal workout which includes walking and jogging. Shoe is extremely light and looks nice. I appreciate the simplicity of the shoe, but question the authenticity. It is supposed to have a removeable insole, but the insole is glued down. There's no Swoosh symbol printed at the heel. I've never purchased a Nike that did not have a Swoosh symbol printed inside of the shoe at the heel on the insole. Maybe this is a new thing given this style is geared towards simplicity offered at a lower price point than other Nike styles. I hope I purchased an authentic shoe instead of a knockoff that should be cheaper than the price I paid for these. These feel nice. Very light, but not great for anyone that needs a wider toe box. This style sharply tapers towards the toe. Overall, feels great while wearing these for a walk or jog."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R34XQCR8KPLWTI,"March 2, 2019",1,Hoodwinked :(,These are not real Nike’s. The swoosh logo is a sticker and not stitched on the shoes. Very disappointed since they cost the same as traditional Nike’s. Returning immediately.
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R16FX3U9556SP4,"March 7, 2019",1,These are fake,"Fake. The insoles are crap, the materials are cheap. These barely have any support and are clearly knock offs. From now on I’m buying sneakers from the manufacturer."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R3LKXAVJ74OQJ8,"July 19, 2017",5,"Slightly narrow, but otherwise awesome","So far, I really like these shoes, which is definitely unusual for me! The tread is very grippy but not intrusive. And overall, the shoe is very comfortable yet supportive. I actually increased my run quite a bit just from switching to these shoes. I would say they are slightly on the narrow side though, just fyi for people with really wide feet, but not enough to bother me (I have a moderately wide foot)."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R19KBKJZ5913DM,"December 11, 2017",5,Very comfortable,"So far I've only worn these a few times but I'm very impressed with these shoes. I'm a home health physical therapist so I'm not only on my feet majority of the day but getting in and out of my car a lot as well. I have had recently some hip and back pain after a long day but with these, I've had no problem. I enjoy the design of the shoes as they facilitate a more normal heel strike improving my gait pattern."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R9FXRWVFIJGFC,"September 7, 2019",2,They hurt my heels :-(,"I was really happy to find out that they fit and at first, when I wore them to take my dog for her walks, they were fine. However, the second day that I started wearing them (and for longer distances i.e. to walk to work), the shoes started rubbing on my heels, big time, especially on my left heel as my left foot is slightly bigger than the right. :-( By the time I arrived at work (1 mile from my house), the left heel was completely scraped and bleeding. For 5 days afterwards, I diligently wore them to work.... with Band-Aids stuck to my heels beforehand, but they never got soft. Really disappointed. I can't return them as they got blood on them. I will just use these as my back-up pair of sneakers, even though my original intention was to make THESE Nike's my go-to shoes...."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R2HB2BOJI2H2E1,"June 6, 2019",4,No the best for narrow feet...,Nike's are always my favorite because I have very narrow feet. These shoes fit well through the heel and arch - but are way too wide at the toe and ball of my foot. IF you had wide feet at the balls of your feet - these shoes would be great for you. They are comfortable so far - but I've only had them for about a week and have walked about 15 miles in them.
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R1J8313Q8T9K2G,"July 2, 2019",1,TOO TIGHT,I BOUGHT THESE SHOES THINKING I WAS GETTING A EXTRA WIDE SHOE BUT THE ONLY THING I GOT WAS A EXTRA WIDE STICKER ON THE SHOW BOX.THERE IS NO WIDE OR EXTRA WIDE ON THE INSIDE OF THE SHOE.THEY ARE VERY TIGHT ON MY FEET.WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R3LIZRNQUP7E7P,"December 7, 2018",5,cute and comfortable,"The shoes are very good looking and simple.  The fit was as expected, but I had to loosen the laces as I have wider feet and they lace them up tight.  Wore them to the gym a few times now and they seem to be working great no blisters no breaking in pains."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R2Q95GB6RJ2NSZ,"July 22, 2019",1,Not very comfy,I ordered a size bigger thinking they would be more comfy but they definitely were not. Sadly I had to return them.
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R297EACOUARH53,"November 13, 2019",5,Good little shoe!!,"I gotta give these shoes credit; they’re holding up after eight months of heavy use. I run 5ks, work in nursing with these, and they’re pretty solid shoe for training and beginning runners. Much more suited for a neutral footfall (found out I overpronate, so we’re following that lead next). Better durability than the downshifter 6 ( I got holes in the toe box of that one). Also, provides a little bit of energy return (for neutral strikers, probably most, not me lol)."
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R1Q60UQPMM0PDG,"November 29, 2017",5,Great for the gym!,Love these shoes! I was worried about the fit as my feet tend to run a bit wide. But I ordered a 1/2 size up and the are perfect. I love the colors - they are neutral enough to go with anything. I've used them at the gym and for aerobics at home. They are light and provide great support. Happy with my purchase!
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R18NNCVBCICY69,"June 12, 2019",5,Love Them!,"They fit perfect, love the support.  Great traction.  They are comfortable."

I purchased them for mu grandaughter who has problems with her feet.  She needs a well made shoe with support.  She runs cross country and says these are comfortable.  I purchased 2 pairs so she could switch them. If you need a comfortable sneaker these are it!"

Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R1ATWEXO89DL8W,"December 18, 2019",4,My go to sneakers,Love the fit soft very comfortable the color is what I was looking for very feminine I wear my sneakers at work and my feet are not tired I compare them to Skechers and I would have to say they are just as comfortable and support my arch and ankles as Skechers do. Only problem is the shoestrings will not stay tied sometimes but other than that I love them
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R3QLHEUKC21A53,"November 20, 2018",5,Perfect,I bought my husband these for his birthday at shoe carnival and was excited to see they had the same one in women’s on here. Ordered a 7.5 and they are perfect! They look exactly like my husbands and they came in a perfect box matching numbers and etc super comfy! Especially for my currently feet that are carrying my super heavy pregnant weight! Would recommend
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R28027W49U5W0C,"January 21, 2018",4,The Ups and downs,I typically wear a 9.5 but with Nike I know I always have to go up half a size. I like the way the shoe fits around my feet. The only thing I didn't like was how the tops rubbed against my ankles. I have to tie the shoes lose and wear thicker socks that cover my ankles so that it doesn't irritate them. I'm hoping I'll have them broken in enough by summer to not have to wear thick socks with them and just ankle socks.
Nike,Women's Downshifter 7 Running Shoe,B00BIIN5AK,R1ER2X5D8CG5WM,"February 25, 2019",5,Wonderful!,Love this shoe. My work is gross and I’m around black oil and black rubber. My shoes never look gross. It works great for me. I got the black on black.

I wasn't aware the way the shoe is designed creates pressure on the top of my foot which causes swelling. I took the shoe off to see what the problem was and saw the design of the shoe was the issue. I tried switching to a, thinner sock but experienced the same issue. I was looking for black on black tennis that look good with my casual clothing for work. I will say for anyone without issue like I have, I love the look."
Nike,Women's Air Max Sequent 3 Running Shoe,B07FB8W32G,R3J9R8MN1WV8KT,"November 26, 2018",1,Painful to wear,"These shoes are made improperly. I don’t know if they are authentic or not, but the way the shoe is manufactured causes pain on the top on my foot. The rigid design does not stretch out and it has a fixed tongue that dogs into the top of my foot. Only wore these shoes once to casually walk in and it was so painful. Then i tried to return them and the seller doesn’t seem to care that they are causing pain in multiple customers based on other reviews I have read."
Nike,Women's Air Max Sequent 3 Running Shoe,B07FB8W32G,R3C8BH1LA7PMEU,"August 19, 2019",1,"Once the ""air"" pocket goes, so do your shoes","I've had these shoes less than 2 months and unfortunately it's too late to return them. I don't wear them on the trails. I don't wear them daily. While running errands today, I noticed the right shoe felt off balance. I look down and the ""air max"" pocket has a flat. I see no punctures, nothing. I don't abuse the shoes. They're mostly for travel and errand running. I weigh 130lbs, so weight wasn't an issue. It's too bad... I really liked them, but now, they've been rendered unusable, I can'f fix them, can't even donate them. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
Nike,Women's Air Max Sequent 3 Running Shoe,B07FB8W32G,R21FR3JM39OG0L,"May 3, 2019",3,Nike womens air max sequent 3,I have bought Nike shoes for as long as I can remember and I'm now 29. I have never wore a pair as uncomfortable as these. The toe is super narrow the middle arch support squeezes my foot to heel so hard that it literally hurts my foot. I wish I would have read reviews on the shoes before buying. The outside appearance they are super cute. But cant walk for ten minutes without my feet seriously throbbing. Wish I could send back but first time I wore them was to my son's track meet so bottoms got dirty. This is not the normal stiffness when breaking in shoes. They still hurt.
Nike,Women's Air Max Sequent 3 Running Shoe,B07FB8W32G,R1LS6QTJRHG196,"September 11, 2018",1,Not for high insteps,Not good for ppl with high insteps. The support seam across the instep dug terribly into my insteps especially the left side. Had to cut open seam because I would have spent more than what the shoe cost to return it. Cutting didn't help so I asked my husband to wear it to stretch it. Still didn't work. Very disappointed with this Nike design. Can't wear it.
Nike,Women's Air Max Sequent 3 Running Shoe,B07FB8W32G,R12EJENSKCKC1F,"June 24, 2019",2,Runs Incredibly Narrow,"Air Max's are usually a pretty wide shoe with a lot of real estate, I was so unpleasantly surprised to see when I slipped these on that my heel spilled over the edge of the sides of the heel of the shoe. It makes it an incredibly unstable fit knowing you could probably roll an ankle at any given moment because your shoe is more narrow than your foot, but I had to send these back immediately and purchase a different shoe."
Nike,Women's Air Max Sequent 3 Running Shoe,B07FB8W32G,R3JGVQ21UUENXB,"October 28, 2018",3,Just ok.,"These shoes do not hurt my bunions. However, they are tight on the top of my foot.  This is caused by the design of the shoe. This has eased a bit with wear. Also, there is an odd pressure on the outside, middle of the foot. I haven't figured out what this is. It's more annoying than uncomfortable.  I think these would be good for someone with narrower feet."
Nike,Women's Air Max Sequent 3 Running Shoe,B07FB8W32G,R2PNXPVC2DY45I,"September 23, 2019",5,Look Great!,"I have shopped for shoes EVERYWHERE, trying to find the right shoe for my upcoming trip. Finally, I have it. They are soft, light, a great color, and look very cool. I ended up putting Dr Scholl's Memory Fit insoles in them to make them even more comfortable for the tons of miles I'll be walking. Very happy!"

Nike,Women's Air Max Sequent 3 Running Shoe,B07FB8W32G,R3IFPMRBRZQWSL,"October 28, 2019",3,Not for high arches,"Ok, everything fits about this shoe, unless you have high arches like I do. There is a band that sits right on top of my arch on the top of my foot that is extremely uncomfortable and almost feels like my foot is losing feeling. No, they’re not tight...just in that arch area."

I have noticed they have a very prominent arch in the shoe, which i have high arches, but for someone who doesn't, it may be a tad uncomfortable."
Nike,Women's Air Max Sequent 3 Running Shoe,B07FB8W32G,R3IERC4BH2W9RW,"January 16, 2019",2,Not comfortable,"I thought these were going to be cushioned since they're Air Max. NOPE. They're hard and  not really comfortable at all. I have cheap, off brand shoes that are so much more comfortable. These DEF not worth the $70 I paid for them."
Nike,Women's Air Max Sequent 3 Running Shoe,B07FB8W32G,R3VC5FK8O9XKQW,"August 2, 2019",1,Doesn’t fit correctly,Product to tight the shoes are to small I always wear a size 9 the one fits perfect the other is way to tight. I’ve never had this problem before. When I got the shoes the box was all ripped apart and a rubber band was wrapped around the box to hold it shut.

You can open the laces but the shoe will not give. The shoe continues to fit extremely tight to the point of pain

The arch support is made incorrectly and entirely too narrow for an average foot. The arch support on the outside of the foot is so high, that it causes me to feel that I am walking with my feet tilted inward.

I'm very familiar with them and previously was wearing/testing out a companies diabetic shoes as my work shoes. Long story short, they created foot pain for me. However, I have another pair of red Nike Air Huarache shoes that I use to work out in and every time I switched to those, my foot pain would dramatically decrease. I finally made the decision to ditch the ""prescribed"" diabetic shoes (less than 6 months old) for this pair and my feet couldn't be more comfortable. These shoes have enough room in them to add orthotics and still fit well without feeling too tight. They have good durability and even come up a bit higher than most shoes for a ever-so-slightly ankle support feel. I could easily see myself wearing this style of shoe for the rest of my life."

She spends 12 to 16 hours a day on her feet as a “Big Box Retail’ Store Manager and up until now she has worn ASICS exclusively as they make shoes designed for her condition. That being said she absolutely loves the Nike Air Huarache! First day and no pain at all plus she said she got compliments all day about how “cool” her new Huarache’s are from all her young staff. A win all the way around, especially for the price."

Shoes look exactly like the pic and were clean with no issues. Shoes are true to size, but fit a little tight so I loosened the laces a bit. My feet are a little wide, but the tightness is also true to this style of shoe. I own another pair and they fit the exact same way. I have gotten nothing but compliments on the shoe every time I wear them."

Unfortunately they dont make them like they use to, i barely used the shoe about 4 times and just yesterday noticed a tear on them. Mind you i only use them on indoor basketball courts. I can now imagine what would happen if i use them in concrete courts."

My last pair of sneakers were in the flex “family” and I took a chance on this pair, usually I prefer to get shoes in the store.  The first day or so my feet had to adjust, but after that they’ve been ideal (except on rainy days with the mesh top).  I’ve been using them for months now and am still incredibly happy with them!"

I typically run 3-5 miles a day, and they are light, flexible, and never uncomfortable. I have tried other much more expensive running shoes, which hurt my knees when I run. (Too stiff for my gait?) I have both 2017 and 2018 Flex and love both. I will never run in anything else."
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B00FVSQ5GO,R2W943SBI5ZS4N,"August 31, 2019",4,Not bad...,"I have mixed reviews on this shoe. Normally wear a size 6 but it was tight. Very similar to the Nike Free RN. Returned and bought 6.5 which is better, however it’s pretty wide so I tightened my laces as much as possible. Not the greatest fit but better than the 6 especially when your foot expands from exercising or running. Shoes are very comfortable though. Haven’t been impressed with Nikes shoe designs lately. I never buy plain black and white shoes but these were the best looking ones I’ve seen up to date."

They are extremely light...like walking/running on air.  They fit perfectly right out of the box...no need to break them in.  Great variety of colors.  I practically live in these shoes.  I have a pair for the gym, a pair for shopping, a pair for lawn work, and plenty stockpiled for when they are no longer available.  In fact, I ordered a pair of the men's for my son.  Love, love, love these shoes."

They are the most comfortable Nike’s I’ve ever bought! I have worn an 8 in some Nike running shoes and 8.5 in others. The 8.5 was perfect in these! They look really good, and I’m sure that I will be able to run faster and jump higher! LOL! Also.. you can’t beat the price for these! I’ve spent way more on shoes for my kids. These are a great deal!"
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B00FVSQ5GO,R1MS7XOZGZXVG2,"May 27, 2019",5,Good arch support,"I was hesitant to buy these shoes because I read that they ran a size small, but this information is inaccurate; they seem to fit as any other Nike 8. I admit when I first put them on, I thought they might be a bit smaller than other Nike 8s, but when you tie the laces and your foot moves into the arch support system of the shoe, the fit is as expected. The shoes give good support for running on the street (of course at 56 yrs, I always look for a little more).  :) with the shoes"

I’m overweight and needed something I could workout in (walk) that wouldn’t cause knee, ankle or back pain. This is definitely a great purchase and I have two other pairs now in different colors. I switch them out so I never have to wear the same pair back to back. They last longer that way and your shoes really need time between use. Will definitely purchase again in a few more months."

I have fairly narrow feet, but I have bunions, so my shoes need to accommodate my narrow heel and have a wider toe box. I also look for a shoe with a straighter last and one that I can put orthotics in without raising my heel so high that the shoe slips in the heel. Well, this shoe is perfect for me! The fabric structure of the shoe accommodates my bunions, too. The first pair I purchased locally at the retail price. They have lasted well, but since my feet are difficult to fit, I started looking for a back up...I couldn’t find anything that fit as well. Then I began looking for the same style I had been wearing...this shoe. I found it here at Amazon! Well, the very best price was for the peachy , pinky colored ones. They are shown in the ad as Hilfiger sandals:0, but I figured if I was sent the sandals I could send them back. However, they are great and are just like my original purchase. I am planning to order another pair today because the price has dropped from low price I paid just last week! Lucky me!"

These are the most perfectly sized and comfortable tennis shoes I have worn in a long time. Others always give me problems in the toe area where it is too tight and make walking uncomfortable. I ordered a size 9 and was worried whether I should size up to a 9.5. Well it fit perfect. So happy with these shoes. Comfofor walking /and I walk a lot! And very pretty!

Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B00FVSQ5GO,R240WEL5SP4SF6,"September 2, 2019",3,"Comfortable, but...","I love these shoes.. for the most part. The arches are supportive, the shoes are flexible and breathable, making them very comfortable normally. But, I walk on a lot of different trails for exercise. For paved surfaces, these are great! But, for gravel or natural trails, things constantly get stuck in the crevices of the bottoms. It causes discomfort while walking when this happens. I end up having to stop to get rocks out of my shoes every 10 minutes or less.  And then it's such a pain to have to take tweezers to these every night, getting rocks and debris out of the slits in them. So if you're wearing these indoors or to walk on paved surfaces they're a great choice, but otherwise stay away!"

This is by far the worst pair of shoes ive ever owned. The color is supposed to be black/dark grey, but it looks more like a hunter green in the light. I ordered a size 9 as I do in all shoes(really need an 8 1\2 but I always order up). I literally had to use both hands to get this shoe on my foot. Needless to say ill be returning these today"
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B00FVSQ5GO,R1NTMYT5O1TC38,"January 1, 2020",4,Comfortable and Lightweight,These are great. They have nice support for the arch of your foot. They’re lightweight and very good for walking and running. I workout between 3-4 days a week and I’m hoping these sneakers will withstand the use. I gave them 4 stars because I haven’t had them long enough to know if they will last with that kind of use although I’m sure they will.
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B00FVSQ5GO,R1GJQ3XH4NS7Z9,"March 28, 2019",1,Not what I was looking for at all.,These shoes have ZERO support.  The soles are far to squishy and too soft to prevent any pronation or supination. much like walking on a soft pillow. I was looking for a supportive running shoe to use and these are NOT it.  Only bonus is they are very lightweight.
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B00FVSQ5GO,R3GMQ46JDCVKY7,"June 8, 2019",1,Loved the color but...,"I thought I would shop for new work sneakers.  I usually wear a 7 1/2 but I when I received this order and opened up the box to try them on...well let's just say I questioned whether or not they were a 7 1/2 and not a definite size 6.  Idk, too small so I returned them.  With Nike's I think I am better off trying them in the store as oppose to ordering them online.  But that's just me...."
Nike,Women's Flex RN 2018 Running Shoe,B00FVSQ5GO,R1M7NA4X98DHC5,"March 27, 2019",3,Not as comfortable as I remember,"I use to wear Nike’s all the time in high school and never really noticed a problem with them. Since then I’ve been trying out different brands, like New Balance, and after comparing the two the NB’s seem more comfortable to me. These shoes are stylish and sleek, but after wearing them for long periods of time they start to feel constricting."

They were much lighter than expected but very supportive. I thought the light weight was a bad sign but no. These shoes were excellent from day one. No blisters and no break in period. I have bunions and they weren't an issue (7.5 m). I run 2 miles/day 6days/week. It's been two weeks and my knees feel great. I'm 53 and I'll be getting these for years to come.

And it’s all I wear. I work at a nursing home. An my feet all the time. They r very comfortable. And light. I’m on the heavier side. And let me tell ya. These shoes are the balm.  I own a pair before had them for a yr and still holding up. Decided to order another pair. Was glad to find them on here. Just and FYI, they run on the 1/2 size smaller side. I usually wear a size 7 1/2 in shoes. In this brand I had to get a size 8 medium. These r all I get now. They have a great arch support. Also helps on my knees and hips."

Worth the money!," As soon as I opened the box they were exactly what I was expecting! I love them so much! They are just like the picture! I got size 9 1/2 and that’s what I wear and they fit so good. I go to Walmart and have to buy Size 9 most of the time because that’s all they have and those are a little snug. These Nikes are true to size. They will hurt your feet for awhile till you break them in. I also have really great socks that are high and thick so I have no rubbing on the back of my Achilles heel area! Very satisfied with my order, thanks these are perfect!

Nike,Precision Iii Basketball Shoe,B07HDSL9ML,R3KKVMO41S99ID,"September 14, 2019",5,Comfortable and great fit,Fit great My 15 year old son said they were the most comfortable he’s had ever for basketball Very happy so far
Nike,Precision Iii Basketball Shoe,B07HDSL9ML,R16YIGJ4LJ14JU,"February 9, 2020",5,My Favorite budget basketball sneaker,"This is a fantastic but economical sneaker for basketball.  It is light and very responsive.  I feel fast and bouncy when wearing it.  Traction is great.  Sticks to everything and seems durable.  Also very, very comfortable.  Every time I put them on I feel ready to explode on the court. They also look great - especially the grey colorway. The materials, however, are a bit on the cheap side - especially the upper mesh material.  I have pushed them hard and they have not fallen apart but it is clearly Nike's budget material.  It is also lacking in some support features - mainly lateral lockdown so I would not recommend this for a heavier player or someone who needs a more supportive shoe.  I personally found the support fine for my needs and never had any issues lateral or otherwise but I am on the lighter side. For a lighter, speedy, guard, however,  these are a great budget option that will make you feel great and delivers a fantastic and responsive court feel."
Nike,Precision Iii Basketball Shoe,B07HDSL9ML,R30VVLKYLQHQQ,"February 1, 2020",5,Most Own!!!,"These are by far the best basketball sneakers for the money.  I love how these lockdown to my ankle and forefoot.  The cushion is also better than expected at this price point.  I actively play twice a week and shoe appears to be holding up really well so far.  Overall a top performer and my current go to! Pros:. Excellent ankle support & containment, great grip, very durable, suitable for indoor and outdoor use Cons:. Lack of premium materials, fit is best for normal to narrow foot, limited colorways, not the most stylish in comparison to the market"

There is a chance to hurt a finger and snap the strap on the back damaging the shoes. Still...I can live with that and recommend the shoes."

Nike,Women's Air Zoom Vomero 14 Running Shoe,B07DCNF22J,R1FCMW0MVDC0C2,"September 4, 2019",1,Disappointed,"Well... i’m really disappointed with this running shoe. It seams like there is a fabric problem with the sole of the shoe or something, because i feel like there’s a rock on the left side of it. Really. At first i thought of giving it a try (maybe after the first use it would disappear... not.) i have used this shoe 5 times and it’s still there. I have tried removing the insole, etc, to check everything... but the problem is still there."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Vomero 14 Running Shoe,B07DCNF22J,R22YSC5CCIRVXT,"May 12, 2019",3,Shoe tongue is really uncomfortable,I have been buying Zoom Vomeros for years. I love the cushioning and fit.  But this one does not fit as well. The tongue is too long and not cushioned and has rubbed the skin off the top of my ankle. I will need to cut it and hope it doesn’t fray.
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Vomero 14 Running Shoe,B07DCNF22J,R3G2O9RKBM0HSO,"January 12, 2020",4,eats socks,"This shoe is delightfully light.  When it arrived and I picked up the box, I thought the box was shipped empty, but it had the shoes in it. However, the tongue of the shoe is very short.  The shoe eats socks, crumpling them under the ball of the foot and the toes.  It seems to be a sock-omnivore, eating all kinds of socks.  As a result after four days of short 2 mile runs I had a blister on my index toe."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Vomero 14 Running Shoe,B07DCNF22J,R2AKPUVMU89D9C,"November 2, 2019",5,Love the snug fit on my low volume foot.,Shoe fits snuggly around the heal while not too tight up front. It is very stable even when running on trails. A little light on protection at the ball of the foot if running on rocky trails. The shoe has good spring when landing on the outside mid foot. We shall see how long it holds up....
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Vomero 14 Running Shoe,B07DCNF22J,R17NRUL5L6UJZ8,"December 13, 2019",5,Comfortable!!,Love these - I’m not a runner but wear them at a retail job where I stand all day!
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Vomero 14 Running Shoe,B07DCNF22J,R3I9N2HWBK1W4L,"February 4, 2020",2,Not like previous versions,I always buy these shoes but this version does not work for me.  No cushion in heel and hate the tongue but the worst part is the heel is kinda triangular and rubs my ankle.  Also constantly makes my socks slide down.
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Vomero 14 Running Shoe,B07DCNF22J,R4MSNH8KYP6WN,"January 6, 2020",5,Wonderful Running Shoe,I had an old pair of Vomero running shoes and needed to replace them.  I was so happy to find these in a light grey color.  They fit just like my old pair.  Super happy!

Nike,Women's Air Zoom Vomero 14 Running Shoe,B07DCNF22J,R3L0ADS7URDLFF,"February 15, 2020",1,Not like previous Vomeros,"I have been buying Nike Vomeros for years - 2 pair a year. Version 14 is nothing like the previous versions I have purchased. The fabric feels very cheap and thin. The tongue is not padded. The support I have found in past versions that keeps my feet from pronating is not there.  I guess I will have to find a new ""go to"" shoe. I returned these and will not buy another pair in the future."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Vomero 14 Running Shoe,B07DCNF22J,R33URLZ0K6IXHX,"July 23, 2019",4,4 Star,Runs a bit long but narrow if you have wider feet (usual Nike issue). Very cushy and bouncy also a little rigid at the same time. I feel like it needs some breaking in. I would purchase again just in a wide.
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Vomero 14 Running Shoe,B07DCNF22J,RJDJUI7BYZWR1,"January 17, 2020",4,Not like old vomeros,I’ve worn vomeros for years - the 14 isn’t made the same and it’s a disappointment. However they are still comfy and have the most cushion compared to other nikes so I’ll wear them. They’re much wider than older vomeros and I had to go down a size- and the front is still wide.

Nike,Women's Court Royale Ac SLP Sneaker,B07H7SF418,RX3XTYWBVSLHV,"October 9, 2019",2,"They ARE comfy, buttttt..","it would have been better, 1st, if the product description didn't slap one in the face with the LIE of having a leather upper, and 2ndly, they are tight AF, the toes on my size 8 were perfect if not for the elastic band on the upper foot. They're so well made, it hurts and cracks my feet chiropractic-style, but probably with less benefits. So, knowing one should probably keep some mason jars to shove into the shoes and also sticking a pin in the elastic to loosen it, would've been much more helpful info from the handful of reviews for this product, rather than the less handy versions of, ""Oh they're too small or large or hurt me so."" In conclusion, I'm still in my 1st week of wearing, but at least I now CAN wear them, despite the measurement width-wise making me feel like I was trying to shove my foot into shoes made for children... which makes me wonder where these were manufactured. :D After not keeping up with trying to stretch them for a few days, ended up having to return. Allbirds, I come back once more."
Nike,Women's Court Royale Ac SLP Sneaker,B07H7SF418,R2OGUZLLXLXK4D,"October 19, 2019",5,Mostly true to size,"Looks great. I’m a size 6 and while the length is perfect, the width of the shoe is a bit narrow. Just barely fits and the side rubs against my foot during extended wear. Overall, a good shoe, but if you have a wider foot, you might considered a different style."

I had to get a half size bigger than my usual in order for them not to hurt the sides of my toes. Once I got the correct size, they’re pretty comfortable. I’ve even worn them to work where I stand all day for 8 hours and my feet only end up A LITTLE tired toward the end. Gonna buy the white ones ones they are available in my size."

I usually wear a 9 1/2 in women’s shoes but I got an 8 1/2 men’s (10 in women’s) and they fit great. I suggest going down a size considering the fact that they are a unisex shoe. It also came with the green bag in the first picture.

Nike,Women's Odyssey React Flyknit 2 Running Shoe,B00V9KO128,R1U3LCBFRAUNZG,"February 14, 2020",3,Way too small.,"I have quite a few pairs of Nike’s, all of them are size 6.5. I got these in a 7 since they were going to be used for running. They are so small, my toes touch the front of the shoe. I would probably need an 8 for them to fit nicely. I tried them on with super thin socks and even then I had no wiggle room. Then as soon as I took a step my toes were not happy with the lack of space."

The size is correct (they run small, so I had to order a bigger size). I use them to go out and walk our dogs—nothing that would be stressful on a shoe. I’ve gone through the gamut over my 50+ years when it comes to tennis shoes. I really like Nike, but this time, I’m not impressed. These started coming apart over a month ago, so I’ve gotten less than five months of very light use out of the shoes. It’s not the quality I expect or pay for."

They were a great design but did not arrive in an original box and the color on side (sole) was peeling off and also appeared to have been worn.  They either have been very old stock or possible a fake.  Either way they were returned for a full refund.

Nike,Women's Court Lite Tennis Shoe,B01A67TGYW,R1XP5JS99HAYIP,"March 16, 2019",5,Have a Walkon AFO device? This is a nice choice!,"I needed a white leather shoe that I could properly insert my Walkon AFO device into and wouldn't lose their shape like mesh shoes. I first saw and tried on the Nike Court Lite shoes in a sporting goods store but it was a half size smaller than what I needed. With the AFO I wear a size 10. These shoes have a removeable insole, a roomy rounded toe area, and look great! If you have an AFO and need another option.....leather shoes that work well with my AFO with a removeable insole are Sketchers For Work Women's Eldred. They are skid-resistant and come in solid black which is great for the job environment."
Nike,Women's Court Lite Tennis Shoe,B01A67TGYW,R3BQNUOWM8I1FZ,"September 10, 2017",5,Perfect,All I can say is that when I put these shoes on they felt like pillows on my feet. It couldn't be true. Certainly they would not have enough support or they would dig into my heel and give me blisters somewhere! NO!!!!! They are perfect. Perfect fit. Perfect support. Just perfect. Now if only I could say the same thing about my tennis game.
Nike,Women's Court Lite Tennis Shoe,B01A67TGYW,R4PIQE05AQH0R,"April 24, 2019",5,My Favorite Brand of Tennis Shoes,"I have big feet (not wide, just long) and ordered the size 11, which fit me just right.  After the shoe passes size 8 it tends to lose it's feminine qualities and begins to look like a big ol' boat.  But I have to wear boats if I want to play tennis.  I love tennis - it's a God-send game to me.  I wore these shoes to a tennis match without going through the break-in procedure and except for a small place on the tongue that was pressing against my foot, they felt great.  I have since worn them several times and no longer feel that irritation on my foot.  These seem to be well-constructed but I can't tell how much of the top is actually leather.  My previous pair of these shoes (which I completely wore out) had leather uppers but I think these might be man-made materials."
Nike,Women's Court Lite Tennis Shoe,B01A67TGYW,R9G0W5FMGWCEH,"December 21, 2018",5,Good Fit For My Feet,I have trouble finding sneakers which give me a good fit around my toes without sliding up and down in the heel.

I ordered a half size up and it works just fine. This shoe is narrow compared to most Nike's that I have purchased in the past. The good is that it is white, not mesh and easy to keep clean while being stylish."

Nike,Women's Court Lite Tennis Shoe,B01A67TGYW,RHW2SA96PYBB9,"June 18, 2019",1,Stiff as a board,My daughter hates these shoes. She has tired to brake them in for ever for tennis. They are stiff so stiff still. She has had them for about 4 months now. I love Nike shoes just not these.
Nike,Women's Court Lite Tennis Shoe,B01A67TGYW,R2UVQQ2HVF88J6,"August 26, 2018",3,Not all shoes are made the same....although neither are people!!!

Nike,Women's Court Lite Tennis Shoe,B01A67TGYW,R16IFJATCS8EK1,"June 1, 2019",2,Not comfortable,These shoes hurt along the outside of the foot. On one shoe you can feel an inside seam which creates discomfort considering all the lateral movement in tennis. Overall just not comfortable. So uncomfortable that I'll have to buy another pair instead of just tolerating these.
Nike,Women's Court Lite Tennis Shoe,B01A67TGYW,RDAJ93A6A730F,"April 3, 2019",1,Terrible and stiff,"I ordered in two sizes and they were both super stiff and uncomfortable. I prefer the Asics tennis shoes, they are the same price and much better"
Nike,Women's Court Lite Tennis Shoe,B01A67TGYW,RS8VTCX2K2TEQ,"June 25, 2019",2,Way too tight,I don’t have wide feet. I bought them in my size. These shoes made me feel like I was wearing pointed heels. My two outer toes went numb after the third day of wearing them. I also had bruises on the top of my feet from the tongue pushing so hard.
Nike,Women's Court Lite Tennis Shoe,B01A67TGYW,RFWDGNEUMPGOO,"January 12, 2017",3,way too tight in the toe box,This shoe looks great and the fit in length was fine but it was very tight in the toe box area.  I only wore them about 5 times before I had to give them up.
Nike,Women's Court Lite Tennis Shoe,B01A67TGYW,R1SMWWJUC4Y5ZW,"April 23, 2019",3,Too narrow!,"Loved the color and style but they were too narrow. I'm a 5 1/2 but I went 1/2 a size up to a 6 and still too narrow.

Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 8 Cross,B0761YP3LC,R2CB34BUC93S2J,"March 13, 2019",5,Good quality shoes,"These shoes are great. I'm on my feet 8 hours or more a day because of work and life on a farm. I had started into knee pain because of old shoes. These never caused blisters day 1, offered good support, and at the end of 8 hours I was still feeling good enough for go for a 20 min run. No more knee pain and I'm feeling great this morning."
Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 8 Cross,B0761YP3LC,R2GMUI5C08L2TR,"July 11, 2019",1,Did not fit at all,"I loved the look of the shoe. But they absolutely did not fit. I wear a 8.5 in every pair of Nike shoes I’ve ever owned. So of course after reading the reviews I went a head and ordered these in the size I normally wear... they most definitely did not fit, I couldn’t even get my foot in the shoe past the tongue even after loosing the strings and all. They are very narrow in width. They don’t not fit true to size at all. I’d recommend getting sizes up from what you normally wear, or just buy shoes in a actual store that you can try them on before buying and save the trouble."
Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 8 Cross,B0761YP3LC,R1TI6TRXFXWE0D,"February 24, 2019",5,Great workout shoe!,"Very comfortable, the shoes are narrow but not a problem for me since my foot is more narrow. Cute color! Can never go wrong with a Nike product."

I would recommend these again and again to anyone!!"
Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 8 Cross,B0761YP3LC,R1B06OHBIP6SEB,"November 4, 2019",4,Order wide & great for crossfit,"Did some research on the nike training 8 and have come to find out that they fit pretty tight. I ordered my size in wide and they fit perfectly. I needed shoes for crossfit and had my eyes on the reebok nano but I wasn't willing to spend that much. So far I've done weightlifting, box jumps/steps, and squats  in these. They seem to hold up well although I'm not too sure how it performs in jogging or running exercises. Would recommend for all sorts of intense workouts."
Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 8 Cross,B0761YP3LC,R2E55V0HZYO1NR,"March 10, 2019",1,DO NOT BUY,"I ordered a 9.5, which is what I wear in ALL OF MY NIKES, but these are a full size bigger. If I had the option to not even give one star, I would. THEN they gave me thr option to exchange for another size and now they don't have any sizes from 8 to 9. When I ordered the shoes they had those options and I almost went a size smaller."
Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 8 Cross,B0761YP3LC,RYM72QTVVLLF4,"October 18, 2019",3,Make sure you either get different laces or double up.,"I love the color and the fit is right, but the shoelaces are terrible! I don't like to have to double knot my shoes but with these sneakers, you are constantly tying over and over again. It's not all that great when I am out on a run or walk. Besides the laces, the shoes are pretty comfortable. Not as comfy as some other Nikes, but I like them enough"

They’re not too small, and if I were to have ordered any larger the shoe would be way to long. It’s a shame because these were so cheap but I’m returning to get a different style."
Nike,Women's Flex Trainer 8 Cross,B0761YP3LC,R10JGAR8LR87UU,"July 24, 2019",4,"Good Shoe, but feels narrow","I bought these shoe for cardio dance and have had them for six months. I love that they are light weight and flexible, but they feel very narrow only in the arches of the foot which, after 30 minutes, causes my feet to cramp. Everywhere else feels great, Roomy toe box, and the heel area is almost too loose. Just that one area of the shoe is weirdly narrow. i'm going to keep using them for zumba, but won't be purchasing this style again."

I have a hard to fit foot - women’s 12w or 11 extra wide.  It’s rare to find a shoe in my size in the women’s section , practically a unicorn to find a women’s shoe that fits me AND is comfortable.

I’m happy that they were available in a wide width— however I suspect that I actually could have used a regular width shoe in this model. They’re also a bit long, so perhaps just a larger shoe pattern all the way around."

I just tried it at home. I don’t think this made for running? It does not bend like standing on a something hard? Bottom line for me it is not for running or walking just does not bend. Maybe it is a good quality but I don’t think it will work for running or walking at all.
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 8 (Wide) Shoe,B07FKMK1LW,R2XIK7GNNHKZ4F,"January 7, 2020",5,These are awesome if you have bunions.,"I bought a pair of these shoes and then got my mom to buy some, too. She's since bought a second pair. Because these aren't a super-structured shoe, they're awesome if you have foot problems like bunions (we both do, hooray for genetics) that make your shoes tight and uncomfortable. I put them on in the morning, I take them off at night, and I never think about them between when I put them on and when I take them off. To me, that's the proof that they're a really comfortable shoe. It's great that they're available in wide widths (again, bunions). Be forewarned that they're typical Nikes and therefore they run a little small. I ordered a half-size up from my regular shoe size, as did my mom. Also note that their greatest strength is their lack of structure -- they're really comfortable, but if you have ankle/heel problems, these may not be the right shoes for you."

I did not like that they are not running shoes like it says! No foot support nothing about this shoe says running they are not active shoes even walking in these shoes hurt. I wore them several times to try and break them in but all it did was cause pain in my knees, I am a distance runner I run anywhere from 5-30 miles a day I tried just an easy 5 miler in these and it was the worst run I’ve ever had I even tried to go a bit further and I ended up walking, I don’t walk!!!"

Nike,Women's Free Tr 8 Running Shoes,B004U1FXRK,R2BD2UNDHFTS0F,"July 6, 2019",5,Comfortable but not for my wide feet,"I have wide feet, so I need wider toe box. These shoes fit small and is normal width, not wide. My regular shoe size is 6 wide, so I needed to size up one size in order to wear regular width shoes. But size 7 is still not wide enough at the toe box. It's too tight for my feet that restricts blood flow. But compared to the TR 7, the outsoles of the TR 8 shoes are wider.  I intended to use the TR 8 for training, so I wanted a wider outsole."

I have very narrow feet, so I always bought Nike's b/c they fit great. Unfortunately I didn't realize how poor these felt until I was working out and walking in them. The heal back is high and rubs on the ankle. I don't think I would buy these again. They are not the same quality as the Free's I've bought in the past."

Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,R2E77LXD1ZIOHF,"February 15, 2019",2,Outsole Wears Away Too Quickly,"I like everything about the shoe, except for the fact that after just one month of running about 15 miles per week, the outsole has already worn away at the outside edge of the heel. I've not had this issue with other shoes. I think it's a design flaw: the outsole is very thin."
Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,RIG2QIRYIELA4,"January 22, 2019",4,Great shoes but swap out the laces,"I’m a 49 yr old 200 lb runner who averages 25-30 miles per wk and I generally stick with lines of running shoes that perform for me. So I was nervous when I decided to try this particular shoe after years of running in the Nike Lunar Glide series, but wow, i’m glad I did it. Took this pair for a 10 mile run right out of the box that was mostly streets and sidewalks, but also had about 3 miles of cross-country in a hilly park and they were fantastic in all 3 conditions. Terrific traction and bounce and the upper wrapped very nicely around my feet. No sliding inside. Have since run 2 miles in them on a treadmill as a warmup to a weight room workout that included squatting and dead lifting (nothing crazy weight-wise) and they performed great again - on the treadmill and while lifting. The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the laces - they suck. I wish I had kept the laces from my last pair of Lunar Glides because they NEVER came untied. These have untied on me twice mid-run and simply can’t be used without being tightly double knotted. I will definitely seek to upgrade the laces, but I have nothing but enthusiasm for the shoes themselves."
Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,R2S8HE1WC9SLB,"July 11, 2018",4,"Cool shoe, too narrow forefoot for me","These are very cool looking shoes, but they just didn’t fit right to me. The forefoot area is abot 25% too narrow for my foot. At first it felt fine, then walking around the house for a few minutes it felt tight. I have had this problem with the Pegasus series, but if I buy ‘wide’ often the heel and midfoot are too loose."
Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,R1ETMAJ0FS87DK,"May 22, 2018",5,Like I learned in basketball never short on shoes if ...,I was kinda sketched out spending 120 on running shoes.  I only used to spend that much on basketball shoes.  Like I learned in basketball never short on shoes if you plan to use them a lot.  These shoes have tons of cushion and adapt to your feet very well.  I have very flat feet and had problems with other running shoes but these are fine.  Worth it if you can afford it.
Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,RVV02J9ZZVINA,"July 19, 2019",5,It seems very slightly small but overall I'm very happy,"I started adding more cardio to my workouts and my old shoes/socks made my feet feel like I was walking barefoot on pavement when I was done. I bought these shoes with a pair of Balega socks and now my feet are not limiting my cardio which is great. I'm sure the socks have a part to play in this but the shoes are definitely more comfortable, my previous shoes were Nike Air Max Torch 4. It took some getting used to as it feels like there is a ton of lift on the heel, some of this may be because I was so used to my old shoes. Also, the toes feel a little tighter, they are maybe a half inch closer to the end of my toes than my old shoes of the same size (recall they were also Nike). I thought maybe they'd loosen up but they haven't, it's not a major concern other than I hope it doesn't affect the integrity of the toe due to increased ""pressure"". The toes are also pointier than my old shoes which adds a little more tightness around the toes. Overall though, I'm very happy with these shoes. I have never been complimented on my shoes but with these I've had three compliments on my shoes in the two months I've owned them... seems weird but hey, they obviously grab attention. (They're black/charcoal color so it's not like I got a colorful pair). Finally, I want to mention that these are the most expensive sneaker style shoes I've purchased as I usually only spend about $80-$90 but these are definitely worth the extra money for the added comfort."
Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,R3UUGFM353WSI5,"September 1, 2019",5,Buy at least one size larger,"The upper part of the shoe is not designed for the correct fit. The lower part of lace (where lace finishes and the toe box starts) is abnormally small and applies a lot of pressure across a small line over your foot. It was painful to walk for more than 10-15 minutes. Returned the shoe and got a size larger (usually wear 11, ordered 12) and it is a perfect fit! The shoe is fantastic and well designed!"
Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,R37IJQKEEPKVCX,"July 7, 2019",5,If you order the black shoes it will have a white sole,The shoe is great and I'm keeping it but it doesn't match the shoe I ordered in the description above being all black including the sole of the shoe. What I received was a black upper and white sole. I like it but not what I wanted. Comfy shoes so I'm keeping them anyway. But I'd prefer to receive the exact item not something different. That's all

Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,R70ZJVE69J7OX,"February 15, 2020",3,For me... Just too narrow,"Quality shoes, the modern design looks good, I received some compliments. The only problem is that these shoes are way too narrow. I have used several brands and models of running shoes, all having their pros and cons, but no matter what I have always been comfortable with the usual size, not with these ones! I could only run for a very few miles, my feet just felt cramped so I had to use very thin socks. I ended up using some other running shoes. Would not buy again."
Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,R3BRQ4JBL3S5X7,"June 2, 2019",5,Awesome Love it!,I love it. Nike never disappoints. They are really comfortable and well worth the price. Initially it took some time to break in and was a bit slippery but eventually it was just right for my legs. These are now my go to every day shoes. Excellent for running and working AND you can also wear them as casual shoes.
Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,R9DFXJTKBAJTU,"July 27, 2019",5,Good Running Shoes!,"I run from 3-12 miles per week (mostly on country roads).  I've tried various shoes in the past - some I like a ton, some I like less.  These Air Zoom Pegasus 35's are ones I like so far.  They are light, they have some cushion, and they run true to size.  There's enough grip that I'm not worried about slipping on wet/rainy roads. Anyway, these aren't the best running shoes out there, but I figured for under $100 I'd give them a try.  So far so good!"
Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,R3K3ETCOBG8IKQ,"June 27, 2019",5,As expected,"Bought these for my husband who just started running last month. He had an old, beat up pair of off-brand sneakers that were hurting his feet. I did a ton of research before purchasing these Nike shoes, knowing that Nike does a great job, but not sure which model to get for my husband's needs. Since my husband doesn't do any serious running (yet), I thought these would be a great option, since he's more interested in speed, rather than distance, running. He loves them and now that I'm looking into running, too, I'll probably get a pair for myself as well. Great quality shoe, fast and reliable shipping."
Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,R2BKDSISIV4QGH,"October 22, 2019",5,One of the most comfortable running shoes on the market!,"Excellent comfort, great feel and fit. The toe box is perfect even for some wider feet, they're not as narrow as most NIKE shoes and they have a bit of give. Cushioning is excellent all the way through your full stride. They are also mostly fabric  so breathing ability is great, I never feel as if my feet are too hot when training or running. This is my 3rd pair of Nike Zoom Pegasus absolutely recommend."
Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,RXIZ5YSKQKOXE,"April 14, 2019",5,snug fit but comfortable,"Liked the lighter feel than my previous Nike Air Structures which are a good stability shoes but a bit heavier. Overpronation motion control was not that noticeably different for the Pegasus, but I only just started running in them. Only time will tell, and if I had to add some arch support through an insert, that would be fine. The shoe is nicely cushioned, but the outsole is firm , unlike the Nike Lunar Glides which have too soft of a tread(I had to abandon those a couple years ago because of this). Overall a well balanced shoe."
Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,R2JZ6ON17UK87I,"April 26, 2019",1,Not brand new shoes and has creases on the bottom,The Shoes came in a blank box and looks like it was maybe used? It has some creases on the bottom like it was worn previously. A bit disappointed with the shoes. It said that they were brand new but by looking at the photo you can tell they are not brand new. Buyer beware. I will be returning them.

I have flat wide feet and though they are a snug fit they have not caused any foot pain, blisters or sore areas and I wore them 3 days at Disney world so lots of walking. Seem to be true to size since I wear 12 and ordered 12 with a good fit. Holding up well so far. Good support"

Where do I begin, uh hey Nike get your freaking sizing right. Also what's with the heel? They sink in the back, causing depression of the heel with every step and making a straight line feel like walking on a taught fishing net--uphill. These shoes are terrible."

Nike,Men's Air Zoom Pegasus 35 Running Shoe,B075ZYR2X7,R16LV8DGAIU39B,"June 20, 2019",5,Best Fit of any Runner,"Nike Pegasus has been the only running shoe that has ever fit me comfortably and has been for the past 20 years.  Tried others, but not as good of fit. They are slightly narrower than other shoes, so is my foot.  I see they make a wider version now, so should be able to fit people with normal width feet.  Very light and the new material is very cool."
Nike,Women's Ebernon Low Sneaker,B078HF2MRP,R3IXM5Z4NHBJRR,"October 22, 2019",4,"Narrow fit, but flexes slightly, comfy and stylish","Love the style and the price is a steal. I have a wide foot and fit btwn 7.5-8 depending on the shoe style. Got these a 7.5 cause 8 was sold out. Again being that my foot is really wide (flinstone feet lol) they do fit tight. The material is solid, meaning not that flexible. However after my 1st wear they have given me much needed stretch where it's no longer feeling too tight. My foot looks slim in these and I know had I gotten the 8 they probably would have been too big in length as these fit perfect length wise. My advice is to order true to your size. If you have an extremely wide foot and don't want to give them a chance to break in, then 1/2 size up. All in all I am happy with the sturdy material and support they give when walking to run errands."

I have slightly wider foot than regular width, and these shoes fit my feet perfectly with medium weight socks. I love that the sole is not thick and light in weight unlike some of the athletic shoes. I love the color, and the silver/grey part appears to be lighter shade to me than pictured. The only complain I have is, with high arch feet, I have a difficult time sliding my feet in with medium weight socks. This problem is solved a the shoe horn. I highly recommend these training shoes. I love the color combination and they are so comfortable."

I have tried other shoes during that period (Hoka's & Asics). I struggle with over pronation and have a big drop in one foot. There is literally no shoe that offers such support than the Nike Zoom Structure. It is not only a stability shoe but a corrective shoe. I have pairs for running (I am a triathlete) and I have a pair for commuting. This shoe has been a life saver for me!

Nike,Women's Air Zoom Structure 22 Running Shoe,B07HYXF2Q7,R33E7WSQE2PQY9,"October 9, 2019",5,Best Nike Shoes Yet,"I absolutely love these Nike running shoes. They fit my foot like a glove! The shoe fits snugly in the heel and then tapers to a narrow instep and then widens at the toebox. This is a perfect running shoe. They make your feet look pretty small. The shoelaces are the correct size so no chance of them coming undone while walking or running. The shoe is black for the most part, but there is a strip near the Nike label that is a very dark blue, so much that I almost couldn't tell. This is a small detail. Love these shoes so much I bought a second pair."
Nike,Women's Air Zoom Structure 22 Running Shoe,B07HYXF2Q7,R3A6G6FBJQQZAI,"December 7, 2019",1,This shoe has given me a chronic heel pain,"These shoes are VERY HARD and have almost no cushioning. My right heel started experiencing pain after I started wearing this shoe. It took me while to realize that it's the shoe that is the cause of the pain. To confirm my suspicions I stopped wearing it entirely for a few weeks and the pain was almost near gone.  The I wore it again and lo and behold the pain was back in a flash. I really cant believe Nike can make such a bad product, and I paid $110 for it - my most expensive shoe :-(  I am hugely disappointed and dismayed that I can't get my money back"

But front flap is sewn too high, so can’t open it wide enough to slip on easily.  The deal breaker is that the flap is too long, so when laced, the flap 1/2 inch too long and comes up to the ankle."

The only issue I have is that in the arch area there are bubbles in mine. (Not sure if that is to be expected) I did not read Any reviews that stated that.  The bubble in the left shoe is more pronounced than the right shoe and is uncomfortable when worn for long Periods of time. We are theme park fans and the last trip to Disney was fun but not for my feet! They are only okay.. I am currently looking for another pair of shoes."

They were out of stock when I went to get a new pair so, I bought them here, on Amazon. I have been wondering since getting them if they were knock offs. They kill the top of my foot. Something to do with the way they lace up. No matter how I adjust them they hurt. Now, the mesh is coming apart all around the top of the shoe. Very disappointed with this purchase."

This shoe has already started to fall apart after only 4 months of regular use . I don’t hike in these they are strictly gym, treadmill and maybe grocery store . Disappoint in how they started tearing apart all over . If it had been a year okay I expect that but 4 months . I have older Nike in my closet that haven’t even fallen apart yet . Disappointed in the material choices here not what you expect. Purchased August and now it’s November and they are ready to be replaced if you ask me that’s too soon"
Nike,Men's Odyssey React Running Shoe,B078JRKGGJ,R3TMJJUKVS9PUO,"October 20, 2018",5,Walking on a cloud,This shoe is great!. Nike did a great job on this one. Feels much like the Epic React  but at a less cost. I have been looking for something that was a soft cushion feeling . Tried many but this one is the one. I went a half size up for more room and it fits perfect.  And Amazon got it to me in the quick two day delivery. Thanks to Nike and Amazon for getting me in a shoe that really does what it should and what I need.
Nike,Men's Odyssey React Running Shoe,B078JRKGGJ,R1K9AIERWRNKRH,"July 22, 2019",4,Great shoe but narrower than expected,"Out of the box, my teenage son loved these shoes.  Unfortunately, he struggled to get them on his feet because the midfoot was narrower than expected.  He said they felt pretty good once they were on and he really liked the look of them as well as the loop in the back.  However, he decided he didn't want to struggle every time he put his shoes on so he went with the Nike Legend React since they were so similar but easier to slip on."
Nike,Men's Odyssey React Running Shoe,B078JRKGGJ,R3U1R3DQU6SVV7,"May 28, 2019",4,If your foot is very wide you will not be able to wear this model Nike.,"Design style and color of the shoe is unique and special. The react sole has a very soft feeling like Adidas Boost material. Shoe runs a bit narrow. Lots of durable tread rubber showing on outsole. These shoes are very light weight, feels like wearing slippers. Was glad the tongue was not fully integrated into the shoe-sock style so a higher arch can fit without too much instep pressure."
Nike,Men's Odyssey React Running Shoe,B078JRKGGJ,REK4Q68O5EXEO,"August 1, 2019",1,"Really, and I mean REALLY, Tight.","I bought these shoes together with another NIKE pair of running shoes. I bought both the same size and to my surprize, the other pair fit great but this pair are super tight on my feet. To the point that I think if I keep them on they might explode! They look good but the size is a real disappointment. Not comfortable at all.. If your feet look like hotdogs, these are probably for you."
Nike,Men's Odyssey React Running Shoe,B078JRKGGJ,R2MZ8T7GY0CB6R,"July 22, 2019",1,Shoes fit tight. Run smaller than size.,"I’ve purchased several Nike shoes before all the same size. Got these and they seemed to fit ok, but wearing them all day realized they were too small and hurt the back of my heals. Had to stop wearing these shoes so wasted my money on them. So sad since they look really nice and have good arch support."
Nike,Men's Odyssey React Running Shoe,B078JRKGGJ,RBSYSIIYU5LT6,"February 3, 2020",1,Not the color demonstrated,"So, the reason I'm leaving a review about these shoes is pretty simple, I bought them as a gift for my younger brother as part of his graduation gift to be exact. I let him choose his favorite out of 12 different Nike designs and he chose these. Upon arrival the color was not the blue that was demonstrated, nor was the color of the Nike Swoosh as you can tell by the photos should have been White. Not that these small details are incredibly important in the life that we live today. My point is, when you're a business owner and having an online story is relatively comparable to being a business owner, integrity and honesty are expected of you. With that being said, if you're going to advertise a shoe that has different color Nike switches and a different color of blue than what your customers are going to be purchasing and spending their hard-earned money purchasing, it needs to be the color they chose for themselves not the color you chose for them. I'd like to say that a refund would be appreciated. But given the fact that this was a special gift for my brother and his graduation, I'm not going to put him to the agony of needing to return these shoes. I hope that the owners of this business for online customers learn to possess an ounce more of Integrity in the future for other people who are shopping online with their store."

Nike,Men's Odyssey React Running Shoe,B078JRKGGJ,RK0F46F3WNDIX,"January 26, 2020",5,A good choice for running.,I recently recently ran 4 miles in the Nike Odyssey to break them in. I have flat feet and the shoes offered a lot of support. The Nike odyssey feels a little tighter than most shoes I have run in but over all they offer good support.
Nike,Men's Odyssey React Running Shoe,B078JRKGGJ,R13R4BZBQ721F0,"February 10, 2020",5,Great shoes,"This is my new favorite pair of nikes. This is my second pair. First one had TONS of miles on them.

Nike,Men's Odyssey React Running Shoe,B078JRKGGJ,R2RWGF82GNFHF,"August 18, 2019",4,Great for half marathons and marathons!,"I enjoy the comfort of these shoes. The only issue I had is that I have high arches and the arches in these shoes doesn’t really support mine, but not too many shoes do - overall I’m satisfied. I actually love them especially the feedback you get from the react outer soles. Great for half marathons and marathons."
Nike,Men's Odyssey React Running Shoe,B078JRKGGJ,R2ZF9ZARXOYA6B,"May 25, 2019",4,Narrow and small,I bought one size up from my normal size and the length is ok.  The width is very narrow for the bigger size.  Shoe support is  good.

Nike,Men's Lunar Prime Iron II Sneaker,B0719QHWC9,R2JJJWDQNDI25W,"December 23, 2019",4,Great Shoes for the Price,"I love this shows. They look great like shown on the website. I bought them purely for aesthetic purposes and I'm happy. I bought the size 11 Regular but they do run a little tight, especially around the ankles and top of the foot. The toes are fine and somewhat roomy. I definitely do recommend going half a size up. I should've gone with 11.5 but maybe my socks are a little thick but it feels a little snug towards the back of the foot. The insole could be more comforting."
Nike,Men's Lunar Prime Iron II Sneaker,B0719QHWC9,R2UTEX2P6652HF,"April 28, 2019",1,Not true to size !!!!,Very disappointed in the fact that I was thinking they were woman's size and ordered to my size for it to end up being men sizes. Besides that the sneakers are very nice.
Nike,Men's Lunar Prime Iron II Sneaker,B0719QHWC9,RCIXBW0GALMLY,"August 27, 2019",5,Completely Satisfied,Shoe was exactly as expected. Great aesthetic and completely authentic. Much better deal than from the official Nike store as well ($40 vs $70). 5 stars.
Nike,Men's Lunar Prime Iron II Sneaker,B0719QHWC9,R23MHZ7DWB2ERY,"August 8, 2019",1,Rubber on exterior tow started peeling the same day,I suspect these weren't authentic Nike's as none of the dozen of Nike sneakers I've had over the years has ever done this the day they were received!

She says they make walking around fun. She isn't running in these, so I'm not sure how they would be for running. The fit was exactly as expected."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R194K42K6XPG4T,"October 13, 2018",1,"Worst fit, Zero Comfort, Not Recommended","I am a 6.5. and at first I ordered a 6.5. It was too tight for me and not at all comfortable. I guessed maybe its because of the size. Then I ordered a 7, but to my surprise its way worst than the previous pair I ordered. It fits me perfectly but the cushioning is not at the right places. I barely walked half a mile and my feet hurt. Worst running shoe ever!"
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R17ZRY8BRP4K6O,"September 5, 2019",1,Do NOT buy these,"Do not buy these. I would be VERY surprised if they were a real Nike brand shoe. No support, no padding. It feels like you’re on concrete at all times. If you want a good pair of nikes without the major high price try kohl’s, sears or even Nordstrom rack for REAL Nikes that are actually comfortable. I bought these because they were cheap but trust me when I say if you actually plan to run or workout in these shoes it better to pay more for the real thing."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R2K18S6ILDZA66,"July 24, 2019",3,Look great but fit ‘small’,"I am fond of Nikes in general. I have tried on many brands and Nikes fit my feet the best - but not necessarily this particular design, unfortunately... I ordered the same size as I normally do but - I love the color and look but they pull down on my toes so it is difficult to move them up and down. I wear orthotics which fit nicely in my other Nikes but in these, the back of the shoes feel like they are falling off my heel. Perhaps ordering a half size larger would help with the toe room but that would probably not assist with the heel height. I will be going back to my old design Nikes"
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,RRVR6TNSGR32T,"November 13, 2019",4,Nice Nike at great price.,Stretchy top and great color at a good price. I always have my own orthotics so I can’t say anything about the arch support. I hope these will be my new go-to shoes. I miss the original Nike lunarglide series...each upgrade did not make it better.
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R2LY8KG9ZJVJBV,"July 13, 2019",2,One needs to order 1 or 2 sizes bigger if you are wearing socks.,"was really excited to get a new pair of nike. am not fond of eye-catching designs and thought this would be a perfect replacement for my old black nike. but perhaps i assumed too much. love the pastel color, but i wish i had ordered a 7.5 instead of 7. dont have enough time to have it replaced with bigger size... i can only wear a thin pair of pump socks on it, my toes are a little cramped and the back of shoes (heel?) tend to be very low... hopefully this pair will remain comfy for long walks as i bought this for travel..."

I was a bit worried ordering shoes online without first trying them on, but they turned out perfect, very comfortable and true to size.  I ordered a second pair right away."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R2JRRLQGAQJLBH,"December 24, 2019",2,Tight fit,I wear Nike’s daily and buy them frequently. Although these were not true to size. They were slightly snug. I returned them and got a refund. They arrived on time and the return went smoothly. I have no real complains other then sizing.. if I prefer again I’d go up a half size

Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R1B8YSQNMC84DV,"January 24, 2019",2,Doubt it's a genuine Nike,"I doubt it's a genuine Nike, at least if to compare quality to those I've purchased from local store few years ago. Return is not free for this seller, though. Paid $16 just to try those shoes."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R8A1L6TD0LLNV,"January 19, 2020",2,Two different sizes,"The shoes looked exactly like the picture and I loved the style... but I was sent one size 8 shoe and one size 6 shoe, so one was very tight and I had to return them."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R2RPUKH9V1QNKN,"July 19, 2019",5,"Comfortable and cute, but little traction","I'm pretty happy with these shoes. They're cute and comfortable but the traction on them isn't great. If you're on a slippery surface, just be careful. I will say that most shoes give me blisters on my heels. If you have a similar issue, these are the shoes may be a good option for you, because I never have had even a hint of that issue with these shoes."

Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R3BMOGT8FMDIE8,"August 31, 2019",4,Nice sneaker - not for low arches,This is a nice sneaker and nice color.  This is not for those who need a arch support - flexes on the sides.  If you have a normal arch these would be great!
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R2MUEMR0CXQWD1,"June 30, 2019",5,"Durable, flexible, comfortable","Great durable shoes, flexible. I use them for work. I’m a nurse who runs around so it’s always important to have something comfortable on your feet."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R1OO1ZBJG9J1ZS,"January 28, 2020",3,Not as comfy as Tanjun,Nice looking for everyday casual wear.  Not enough support/cushion for my lengthy (4 mi) daily walks.  Tanjun by Nike much more comfy so these were returned.  Wish the Tanjun came in more colors or patterns.
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R3BL4LH91G5VC5,"November 9, 2019",5,Super cute and great for HITT workouts,Nike usually runs slightly small on me....I ordered a size bigger and they fit perfectly.  Super cute and fashionable too
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R1TTAAR233I614,"February 6, 2019",2,Feels flimsy and is too tight but also wrinkles up at the heel,"Feels a little flimsy. I mean, I enjoy a light running shoe but this doesn't feel very durable. Also it has one of those heels that sort of wrinkles up on you and tucks under, like the sock that slips down and disappears into your shoe, except that this is the shoe."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B071NSSTDP,R2LTU5ZSW546BO,"December 18, 2019",4,exactly as pictured,Fit as expected.  I have a wide foot so went with a 10 like I do for all closed top shoes. colour is exact..fit is right

Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R1JS64T951NFBJ,"November 5, 2017",5,Purchased for traveling & walking. Very impressed!,"I usually don’t purchase Nike’s because I’d never found a pair with the arch support I need. These are different; they are so comfortable and provide great support for my feet. The shoes are solid, while also being breathable. A+."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R1WCP0R5LHLA00,"December 20, 2017",5,Best Shoes For Aching Feet,"I work in retail and stand/walk for 8-hour shifts. I tried all kinds of shoes (including other Nikes) and different shoe inserts to help ease the pain in my feet at the end of the day. These shoes feel like like walking on a cloud! My feet don’t hurt at the end of the day, and I don’t  have to wear ugly orthopedic shoes. These are great looking and functional. If you have foot pain like I do from being on your feet all day, BUY THESE SHOES."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R22A66F01FB3SN,"July 28, 2018",1,Fake,"DO NOT BUY THESE!!! I've had these shoes for a few months now, and I needed to buy work shoes. So I went into the store and saw the ""same "" pair of Nike Tanjun sneakers...the ones I bought online are fakes. Don't buy them! They are way more expensive, have a fake sole that are supposed to be a squishy memory foam material,  and they fall apart after being used for a few short months. Not happy with this product!"
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R1NMADB4OL4579,"October 10, 2018",3,These Don't Hold-Up Over Time,"These shoes fit as expected. They are very comfortable and very lightweight. Brand new, they were very stylish. I really enjoyed the shoes. That being said, I bought these for work. I'm in IT and our floors are concrete. If I walk in the city for lunch, it's less than 1mile a day on sidewalk, if at all. After about 5 months of daily semi-daily wear to work (where I mostly sit down), the tread on the bottom of these shoes disappeared. The lightweight effect is a trade-off for durable tread. Nike's shoes made for walking/running never did this to me (except for long distance hikes for 1-2 years). I was walking on the sidewalk a morning after rain the night before and fell flat on my ass! The tread is mostly worn off the in the parts where there is 0 visible remaining tread, there are actually divers which I believe are capable of growing into actual holes. Overall, I liked the shoes, but considering I didn't put a lot of miles on them, I would have liked to get more than 5 months for a $60 pair of shoes."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R2K20X3QXGLQ41,"January 26, 2018",5,Perfect Nikes,I had purchased Nike tanjuns before and absolutely loved them. I was a little worried about purchasing them online but they are the real deal! They are so comfy and the perfect workout sneaker. So happy and they are gorgeous
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R2VOJQC3PIF3KB,"November 9, 2017",5,Love these!!,"So comfortable and stylish for hip hop dance class!!! Good support and they feel really light weight which is nice!!! I love them! I am a 7, and very true to size!"

Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R3IMZIFMVQBV6R,"December 5, 2017",5,Footbed is very comfortable; toe area very little room,9/18/2019 UPDATE: I still love the shoes but I’ve realized after owning many pair that there is very little room in the front of the shoe (toe area). I didn’t realize just how little room there was until I washed them and they shrunk A LOT! I’ve always washed my athletic shoes but I’ve never had a pair shrink as much in the front as these did. I did use a shoe stretcher and it helped a little bit. I have planters faciatis and my feet hurt all the time. But this is my second pair of Nike Tanjun. They’re the most comfortable athletic shoes I have ever had and I plan to order more colors.

Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R1CVF8B2DVCF5M,"July 3, 2018",2,No arch support or padding,"I was trying to find a running shoe with arch support but these have absolutely none, as they are all fashion and no function. The footbed is hard and flat as a board (see pics). If anything they make your foot overpronate because the inside arc of the outer shoe is fashionably carved out. They are cute but I would mess up my feet pretty bad running in these. Mine also came with a perforation in the toe area so I’ll probably end up returning. Not the quality of “running shoe” one would expect after dropping $80."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R24JS2PP0WD5SP,"April 10, 2019",2,too small with bad seams,"i’m super disappointed. these shoes are very narrow and small. my shoe size is an 8.5, always dead on, and so i ordered an 8.5 and unfortunately they were too small and tight. there was also a ridge on the instep sean (right under the arch) and it was really uncomfortable to walk on. i submitted a return. if you have narrow feet, order a half size up and these will probably work fine for you. they were awful for me. the design is darling (i ordered the black with rose gold detail) and i sooo wish they’d worked for me. looks just like the image. arrived on time as well, just terribly sized. also - i went to a local dsw and found this same shoe (same price) and tried it on in a 9 just for kicks.. the toe area was more acceptable, however there was still an uncomfortable ridge on the instep."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R5VFR5D21VDQ8,"June 28, 2019",5,Comfy and great fit,"This wasn't on Prime. I was given an ETA of 2 weeks and yet it arrived 5 days earlier than expected which made me really happy! It fits well. Love the colour. I've only used it for my trips to the store so far and they have been comfortable. Would love to see how they hold up with more intense activities. Overall, I am very pleased and satisfied with my purchase."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R2Y6BWJDKEHAAX,"August 18, 2019",2,Horrible shoes,"I don't know if I've ever given a poor review like this. I bought the black tanjuns with gray swish. I loved the color at first. But maybe they are not real tanjuns, as they are COMPLETELY different from my previous pairs. They fit REALLY oddly. The toe box is so strange that it makes a flopping noise when I walk. The shoe is not shaped correctly, at least not for a women, and comes up too high near the ankle and really hurts to walk in. The fabric is very different from previous pairs, made with what seems like a super cheap material. I don't understand how these are even sold."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,RYM5EWYKSIJ8F,"December 3, 2018",5,Great price for these shoes!,"I like NIKE.  Ordered an 8 1/2 and they fit perfectly!  Great material, enough toe room and black color looks dressy.  I can’t wear heels anymore, very flat feet and because of 2 herniated discs in my lower back with nerve damage down my left leg and left foot, only these shoes will do."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,RYPMRWVK6C12F,"November 20, 2018",2,Disappointed,I bought those sneakers for a special volunteering job. They made me trip every time I wore them. They were catching on the floor and I am glad I did not fall... and break a hip or a hand  I had to go and buy another pair from another brand... Something in the way the soles were manufactured was not right for all kinds of flooring. Buyers beware!!!
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R3BCMUTM2ZNY2I,"July 14, 2018",4,ONLY TOLERABLE NIKE IN WIDE,bought a 7EE and a 6.5 reg width for comparison and because the EE only comes in black. SAME FOOTBED AND SOLE! but the extra wide had more mesh upper material and was significantly roomier. keeping both cuz they are cute but the EE more tolerable and accomodated a bunion. had to break them in for a day or so but good shoe for nike which does not cater to special orthopedic needs.  these are the only nike shoes i can wear comfortably.
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R17OJKHJH1OX5A,"August 26, 2018",5,Best Shoe Ever,"It’s a really great fit I have big feet and this shoe is perfect plus, when I walk I can feel the breeze coming into my shoe making it feel more relaxed and these shows are great for work and I stand a lot and walk around a lot to help people out. Still, these shoes are amazing and I can’t wait to use them in the gym I really needed shoes for the gym and I heard these guys were great to wear at the gym to workout. I highly recommend getting the shoes."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R1TN4VN0SAYK3,"October 1, 2018",5,extremely comfortable!!,"I read other reviews of women who had foot problems and these shoes helped their feet. Well, I'm all in on that conclusion. These are the best shoes I've had in eons. I definitely recommend these shoes and will definitely buy another pair. As a side benefit, the other night I spilled tea and some of iit got  on my shoe. I took a damp sponge and wiped it off -- good as new!! Worth every penny."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R2KJPYSMAL7QZW,"October 4, 2019",5,All Day Comfort!,"I am extremely pleased with the delivery and the product!  These shoes have saved my life!  I work part-time for a network and several times per year we have to work at different shows.  Well, I have tried every show from less expensive to very expensive and by day two and definitely by day 4 (because of the extended walking and standing required) my feet and legs hurt so bad that I wanted to cut my legs off at the knee and sit them on the side! Lol. I am literally on my feet for 8-16 hours per day! So, I went online and typed “most comfortable Nike shoe,” and this one popped up, and the reviews were on target!  I can honestly say that these are the most comfortable shoe I could have ever purchased!  The only thing I would mention is that they run about a 1/2-1 size too small.  I purchased the first pair from Nike and when I went back to purchase a larger size they were out of stock.  Fortunately they were available from another vendor and I was able to get them delivered before I left for my trip."
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B07BQZK4PR,R15EJBQODWFTIS,"June 30, 2018",5,So comfy!!,"Soooo comfy! The first pair of shoes I have worn that were comfortable from the second I stepped into them!  Great breath ability too.  I have very wide feet, high arches and insteps. Nike shoes NEVER fit me properly because they usually have a very narrow toe box. I ordered the extra wide (2E) and they don't need to be broken in or worn a few days to feel good.  They are the best tennis shoes I think I have ever worn!!!"

This has made a huge difference.  This is not the first time I purchased a nike shoe that needed an upgrade with the soles.

I am usually always an 8 but i decided to go with the 8 1/2. They just felt more comfortable and it might be because there is no 'tongue' on this shoe. It's all one piece. SO COMFY! I searched forever for a new black pair of trainers and was so excited when I found these. Will be replacing the black laces with white though (not included).

I did a few workouts in them, walked a few miles in them and each time they became more and more uncomfortable. The final straw was having to remove them just to finish a workout."

Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R3FSWFX3H911K7,"July 16, 2018",1,Fake Fake Fake,"These are definitely a fake. I purchase this exact shoe atleast once a year. I knew the minute I opened them, they weren't made out of the same material as the ones I purchase usually from an actual shoe store. Fast forward 3 months later and they already looked worse than my pair from 3 years ago that I wear when I work outside. All smashed in and ripped on 1 side. Garbage."
Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,RFKL1ME32JPTG,"April 14, 2017",5,Five Stars,Love my cortez's. Wish they were much cheaper. Could go to fooocker or finishline for the same price.
Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R1EKLG53ABQGL6,"January 23, 2018",1,the quality of the shoes is good. however,"the quality of the shoes is good. however, i tried it first time today after i changed my clothes at the hospital knowing that it will fit and be comfortable, since i have 3 other cortez with same size, although, it felt tight and uncomfortable. its very pinted and feels solid, in which i couldn’t walk properly. i would have returned them if i knew it would be like that. my all other cortez that i bought are the same size and feels the same except this one. i don’t know why. am literally disappointed knowing that i wasted my money"
Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R9J0HQOL9S1JN,"July 9, 2019",4,Classic look and fit - Quality is not what it once was,"I have been wearing NOTHING but the Nike Cortez for every day wear for over a decade now.  I get a new pair about every 10 months or so, or at least, that was the routine.  I have had about 15 pairs of these in the past 12 years. The last couple of pairs have looked and fit as expected, but have not worn very well over time.  Leather cracks quite quickly and the soles seem to wear faster than they used to as well. That being said, I am a creature of habit, and love the look of the Cortez.  They work well with jeans or shorts, and are a clean enough look, that they wear well for business casual with chinos or nicer jeans.  I will keep buying them unless/until they quality reaches a point where I'm forced to give up what I consider to be a very classic look."
Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R1TK8WOPTI7CTZ,"January 3, 2017",5,old school at its best!!!!!,"One of my all time favorite sneakers from early 80s growing up along with adidas superstars and suede pumas back in the days, my mom bought me quite a few of these growing up cause i loved them so much, but no these dont look identical to the ones made in the 70s and 80s, they were way better looking before, the riggid look in the bottom was more rugged looking and even the whole bottom sole was thicker and when you compare pictures of these to vintage models the nike swoosh logo on the side of the sneakers was way better looking these newer models it looks dull so curvy like the ones from the past and the blue or from back in the day was nicer and also the suede in the front and back was a more darker and faded than the nylon part which gave them a better pop look and if you observe these carfully with vintage ones from the side these look dull and regular while older models from the side looked sort of like a mean shark would look from the side, just shear beauty, wish they would make them like back in the day but anyway still a beautiful sneaker and please order half size up, nike cortez have always run small, evetyone in my house has them, wife, kids and everyone needed half size up."
Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R2QXWM1RO459IO,"December 13, 2018",5,The perfect classic for style and comfort!,"I have a high arch, so I can’t wear flat shoes or I’ll be in pain after a few hours. The Nike Cortez have been my go-to casual shoe that I can wear all day in blissful comfort, and walk around in with style instead of having to wear actually running shoes like a grandpa. I now have six pairs of these shoes and recommend them to anyone who wants a comfortable walking shoe with more style than wearing running shoes in public during the day. These are what Steve Jobs should have worn in place of his ugly running shoes."
Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R3PE05NZVST8PN,"April 15, 2017",5,Nike Cortez,Always wanted a pair of Nike Cortez shoes and I'm glad I ordered to my size. Not a loose fitting 12 but a snug 12.I thought these were going to be the shoes I would actually have to go to a brick and mortar store to buy but I lucked out. If I sized up like a lot of reviews say I would have returned them. Width wasn't a problem my feet are slightly narrow. With a bit of breaking in I'm sure of comfort. The stitching is good and the leather is real. Couldn't be happier. Quick delivery too.
Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R2J9NF60FZLYRM,"June 15, 2017",5,Like meeting an old friend after a long absence.,"Like many others, I feel the fit is slightly on the small side right out of the box, but due to the more than sufficient padding throughout the shoe, I feel they will be perfect when they are fully broken in. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that these shoes are available once more. For me they are the ideal driving, all around casual shoe. NIKE, please keep making them."
Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R1RZPGEOP36P58,"October 1, 2018",3,"Nice, but...",I’m overall satisfied with this purchase. I’m a bit disappointed with the amount(or lack there of) padding. I feel like these were made better in years past. I have been buying “Cortez” for years and these are not of the quality that I remember. They are nice but...

Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R28COFMG4TJDXN,"October 4, 2016",4,Order a size larger if you want it to fit like other Nike's,"It's hard to buy things off the internet and assume they will fit perfectly.  I had previously purchased a pair of Nike Airmax LTD3's, in the same size, and they fit perfectly.  The cortez's on the other hand are a bit too short and skinny.  Great looking shoe, I would just buy a size or 2 bigger."
Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R7UACQ3WWQKFJ,"January 5, 2019",5,Good for girls too!,"I bought these cause the style and price were right. Although these are mens they are not super wide. I purchased the 7.5 in mens and I normally wear a 9 in most womens brands (sometimes a 9.5 in nike womens because they can be narrow). The fit is pretty much spot on - a 7 probably would've have been ok too, I have a little under a 1/2 inch left at the toe. They are not too wide, in fact they look narrower than many of my womens running shoes. They fit great however they do not have a super padded footbed. Overall, good buy & would recommend."

Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R2HAKYM1SHQG85,"April 11, 2019",4,Top quality,I love these in fact if I could afford to wear a pair each year for the rest of my life I'd buy a pair as needed because the quality is hundred times better than any I find made in this current era.. I love the red swoosh the most but they are double the price and I'm on a fixed income so have to settle for black swoosh which are just as comfortable and look great too!
Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R1HX8BOHH1IOUR,"August 27, 2019",4,Classic hot pink cortez,Nice classic show in got pink. Just what I was looking for. I have many pairs of Cortez but these one in particular has a narrow and unstructured toe as it's nylon not leather. I wear a 8.5 to 9 and got 9 to have some extra room as they do come narrow... and maybe should have gotten 8.5 better.  Overall excited to wear them
Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R2SC6D7RJ89S7E,"June 10, 2019",5,LOVE THEM,I love these sneakers. They look better in person than in the photo. The color is vibrant. The material is nylon and suede. In the picture the nylon looks like canvas or even denim (it is not). If you like that vintage Nike look these are the ones for you. The only glitch I had was that I ordered them in my size (9) and they were extremely tight. I returned them for a 10 and they're great. I probably could've gotten away with a 9 1/2 but i have no complaints about the 10's. They are extremely comfortable. I'm considering getting them in other colors. I like to wear classics like Levi's and Ray Bans. These suit me perfectly.  Dear Nike - please bring back the Roadrunners!
Nike,Men's Classic Cortez Leather Running Shoes,B07KFPTZ9F,R3ICARXXU7LJTE,"June 25, 2019",3,Was expecting black,Turns out obsidian is more of a Navy blue. Would've been nice to visibly see that before purchase. Thankfully my husband's ok with it but otherwise he'd not normally pick out Navy blue shoes. Update about a month later: They are falling apart! The older Cortez shoes he had before lasted five years! What gives?!

The shoe ran 1 size smaller than the real Cortez I purchased last week. And there was no padding around the collar. And the leather looked horrible.
Nike,Girl's Youth Cheer Sideline IV Cheerleading Shoes,B0761Y21KJ,R3F8PZYKEQN9G7,"November 2, 2018",1,My daughter hates these sneakers but we can’t return them. Waste of money.,"I bought these for my daughter who does all star and football cheer. I wanted a second pair of sneakers for her so her competition sneakers wouldn’t get overused.  They fit fine.  She wore them to the gym just once so I can’t return them, unfortunately.  She said they were too stiff to tumble in and that everyone was asking her if they were even cheer shoes.  Maybe they are fine for cheerleaders who don’t tumble, but definitely not okay for cheerleaders who tumble."

They fit comfortably and look good. The only thing I don't care for is that the tongue of the shoe isn't the same shade white as the rest of the shoe. You wouldn't notice from any distance, but up close, kind of strange."
Nike,Girl's Youth Cheer Sideline IV Cheerleading Shoes,B0761Y21KJ,R28Q7WUYHVYEKX,"January 10, 2020",5,Actually cute white leather sneakers!,"Got these shoes for a required nursing program uniform where I required “white leather shoes” and these sneakers fit the bill. I was worried that the top by the toe area would be mesh but it is surprisingly not and is a solid material but still looks like mesh (for style). I was also happy with the sizing and felt it fits similarly to my other Nike sneakers I own. Overall, very happy with these sneakers as a stylish alternative to a bland white leather sneaker!"

I've been cheering in Nike Sidelines since 2010 and LOVE them. If you are not used to cheer shoes, you might think that they are too tight, but they stretch to the perfect size after a single wear (they don't expand more than needed)."

It's like walking on marshmallows. I actually have no more foot pain during the day...I believe I can walk miles and miles without sore feet.  I'm hooked and will probably be buying in many colors. SOOO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

It is light and flexible and yet still they feel very supportive. I purchased these for an upcoming trip to Berlin where I anticipate a lot of walking so I will updated it when I get back. But based on the feel so and look so far I love it. The white on white is super minimalist which allows it to be super versatile. I’m planning on bring only one other pair of shoes.
Nike,Women's Tanjun Running Shoes,B018TE4UZY,R2F8JW87MV281K,"December 22, 2018",2,Not for wide feet.,"I needed a new pair of running shoes and saw all the high reviews on this Nike shoe. The high reviews plus the affordable price for me sold on this shoe. I typically buy a half size larger due to the fact of my feet swelling while I run. I will say I felt like I was running on pillows. The shoes are som comfortable for running, I felt like I could run for hours. The only thing I would suggest is buying a half size larger because they do run a tad bit small. Other than that I have no complaints. I have to update my review. At first these running shoes were som comfortable, however since using these new pair of shoes, I’ve had constant problems with my ankles,, and toes going numb. If you have wider feet, I DO NOT recommend this shoe. Waste of my money"

I live in Florida and am used to wearing sandals however I joined the gym and closed toe shoes are a requirement.  My granddaughter suggested I buy these shoes because of the mesh uppers, being lightweight and offering good support. Well she was right on all accounts.  They are so comfortable and my foot does not feel restricted.  I ordered my son a black pair, however the have not arrived yet. He is usually a Reebok man however I bet he will love these shoes,"

I feel supported when I lift heavy and also that I have the padding needed for running, tuck jumps, box jumps and med ball taps. The ball of the foot is well cushioned, but not so much that you feel unstable. I have owned 2 pairs of this exact shoe and they are my favorite. My mom got a pair as and she has narrow feet (but got a med width) and really liked the amount of support that these shoes offer a narrow foot. My foot is average width and I think they are great without being too tight."

But for me there wasn't enough support. I've had trouble in the past w breaking my ankles. So unfortunately I had to return this shoe.
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Running Shoes Gray/White,B071444ZWK,R39NDZ7LP5LEN9,"December 10, 2018",5,Great shoe with some support,"I feel like this shoe has a small amount of good support.  If you need some arch support these may be for you.  The length is where I'm on the fence.  Some Nike I wear a 10, others I wear a 10.5  I thought the 10 would fit here and they do, but it's just a small amount of rub on the one toe on one foot.  So I'm on the fence as to if the 10.5 might be too large.  I really wish Nike were more consistent in their sizing. That being said if you usually fit just fine in a 10 these should fit as expected.  If you are borderline you'll have to try both sizes like me."

Nike,Women's Air Max Dia Fashion Sneakers,B07QNRDX5C,RM7FDQT31G4RH,"December 12, 2019",1,Falling apart,"I loved these shoes until right after the return date was expired. These shoes started making a popping noise about 4 weeks after my husband purchased them for me. I had only worn them a few times. It was a loud obnoxious popping sound. I decided to wear them to walk in because I would not hear the sound with my headphones on. Well after I finish walking, I look down to find the pink band was falling off. They are pretty and comfortable for about 4 wks then they are ready for the trash. I am really irritated that I wasted our money ."

Nike,Men's Kyrie Flytrap Basketball Shoes,B07BTJJY7Z,RSW65FYB5MLRS,"October 21, 2019",4,"Good shoes, nice colorway, but a little tight in toe area","So I got these and they seemed to have a little bit of an extended break in period... on the heel. My toes are a little crowded in them too... not length wise, but like my 3rd and 4th toe... it's hard to explain - but I've got black toe on both feet on my long index toe and 3rd toe on my right foot. I think it's the shape of the curve. I wish I had gone up 1/2 a size to compensate... but too late now. Anyways the shoe performs great, has great grip, good traction throughout. It's also made of good materials. The color and look is amazing in my opinion - better than the newer Kyries. *Note - I had the top portion tear slightly where the inner lining transitions to the leather... opponents shoe must have kicked it on a rebound or something. In summary not my favorite shoe, but it's still a great shoe with great style - I think if I had gone up 1/2 size things would have been peachy. I'm upgrading to the new DON issue #1's by Donovan Mitchell and Adidas. Went to a 12.5 size this time :) these will serve as my backup shoes."

I love it, looks amazing and has incredible grip and bounce. It gets dirty very quickly though. So I would recommend getting a cleaner immediately with the shoe, because if you play more than once a week, it might need a weekly clean if you care about keeping the shoe bright white But for the product itself, it is incredible"

After using these shoes, they are all gone, for, this shoes apply brakes wherever you want to and whenever you want to. Sole is worth the money you are paying for.

Nike,Women's Zoom Cage 3 Tennis Shoe,B078B41LLS,R3CYU33WSYKNSY,"August 21, 2019",2,Great color combo but terrible quality,"This is my 4th pair of Nike Zoom cages and these were terrible. I play tennis every day and after 4 days the lining on the inside of the heel of both shoes shredded and now the plastic shell just scrapes my heels. Unwearable after 4 times, and $130 wasted. The same thing happened on all my prior pairs, but it took months of daily wear before it happened. Maybe these were fakes. Will go back to purchasing directly from Nike, but if it happens again, it'll be time to find a new tennis shoe. Note: I've seen others comment on outer sole issues - I play daily on hard courts and have never had an issue with the outer soles. Giving 2 stars because the shoes fit great, like gloves and your foot feels very stable but not heavy; also, nice colour combo. Adding an update to this review: Tried to work with Capital Athletes on a resolution to address the lining shredding after only 4 wears. Rather than extend any kind of refund or credit, or even refer me to Nike, they tried to blame it on the socks I wore (the same socks I've always worn with my Zoom Cages - Nike Elite Performance socks). Absurd, and a clear indication that Capital Athletes could care less about the satisfaction of the customer. As I said in the original review, will purchase directly from Nike in future or from Tennis Warehouse where you at least have some recourse when an issue occurs that absolutely should not occur after 4 wears and that never occurred with prior pairs."

One tip; give yourself a couple of extra minutes to put these shoes on as you will need to adjust the laces twice. Once to put them on and again once they're on your feet for comfort/security...I know I know we do this for all sports shoes, however, the material they're made of doesn't allow a lot of give to the laces."

Unfortunately this shoe was still too narrow for me.  The cushioning is very comfortable, and it doesn't feel that snug - but after about 1/2 mile my feet were cramping in the middle of the lateral side, just under the base of the Flywire.  I think I am going to have to go with a different model that offers wide sizes like the Vomero, but I wanted to try this first since Hes mentioned that it was wide foot friendly.

Great running sneaker and a comparable amount of comfort to the Adidas Ultraboost. However, what made me return these shoes is the lack of support in the heel. I'm both a runner and use these as daily drivers. I was surprised at the lack of heel support these shoes had which lead me to understand why many also complain that the two outsoles begin to separate at the back of the shoe. Lack of heel support so much so that I would say you almost feel as if you would fall back if too pressure was out on the heel."

Nike,Zoom Fly Flyknit Women's Running Shoe,B07HYSKHFZ,R15FSVFV5ZUX6K,"March 14, 2019",1,BUYER BEWARE!! Will not give you full refund!,"I bought this item based on my Nike sizing this was incredibly too small . I sometimes where a 7.5 but when ordering online I go bigger , these arrived and they were to short . Buyer Beware YOU WILL NOT GET A REFUND , they will be crooks and charge you a restocking fee for wrong sizing and then label it “buyers remorse” stay clear"
Nike,Zoom Fly Flyknit Women's Running Shoe,B07HYSKHFZ,RY0CFOXWQ3EWD,"March 20, 2019",2,Not for me,"I really wanted to like this shoe for racing shorter distances (5 and 10k) but it just doesn't work for me.  The toe box is narrow and short, even after sizing up a half size.  It feels like my feet are on a narrow cushy platform and might fall off.  I don't have super wide feet. I honestly think Nike works for some runners, and not at all for others."
Nike,Zoom Fly Flyknit Women's Running Shoe,B07HYSKHFZ,R3BB1GW8SJOCHN,"June 18, 2019",1,Factory defect. Awful mismatched fit.,"When I first got this shoes I thought I was crazy, right one fit fine, a bit snug, but comfortable. Left shoe though, immediately felt way too tight on my toes, so much it hurt. I checked the size and they are the same size according to label. They seemed same size. But after unsuccessfully trying to wear them and closer examination, a factory defect was very apparent. The outsoles are in a different position from one shoe to the other."
Nike,Zoom Fly Flyknit Women's Running Shoe,B07HYSKHFZ,R3KADD4QDHCJ0P,"March 28, 2019",5,Great fit and very cute shoe!!!,"I seriously don’t understand the bad reviews about this shoe, I was so afraid to order because of the reviews saying the shoe was too narrow and uncomfortable, I consider I have a bit of a wide foot so that was another reason for me to be afraid, so after days of thinking about it I decided to purchase, on regular shoes I wear a 7 but in sport shoes i try to go half a size bigger for extra room, so I ordered 7 1/2, the shoe color is exactly like the picture, they are super cute and they fit like a sock on your foot, very soft, light fabric, very comfortable, not tight at all, good arch support, i have a little bit of extra room at the end of my toes, overall I do recommend, cute and comfy, you can’t ask for more!!! I loooooove them!!!"
Nike,Zoom Fly Flyknit Women's Running Shoe,B07HYSKHFZ,R3BYGV8F5I9O9O,"November 20, 2019",3,Order 1/2 size up. Not for wider feet!!!,"Ordered a 1/2 size up and these sneakers were definitely still snug. Not exactly uncomfortable?? But it felt like I was wearing 2 layers of compression stockings. The cushion is great, but I’m not sure these shoes are worth it considering the sizing issue. The laces are basically just for show because you have to slip these on. I have average width feet, I normally wear size 6. If you have wide feet or like a roomier toe box, these will not be comfortable for you."
Nike,Zoom Fly Flyknit Women's Running Shoe,B07HYSKHFZ,RJI8JTLOKPFER,"October 25, 2019",5,Like gloves for my feet.,Wow. These are the most comfy shoe i have had on in a while. It has a pretty think cushiony heel.  Makes me about an inch and a half taller. But... wow. So comfortable. The only negative is... they are impossible to wear with socks. They are so snug... I could not get my foot in with a sock on. They are essentially slip ons.  You dont have to untie to put on or take off. I wish i could afford to buy every color.
Nike,Zoom Fly Flyknit Women's Running Shoe,B07HYSKHFZ,R2ZAX1IELSDYLF,"February 5, 2020",5,"Fashionable, comfy walking shoes","Love the Nike Zoom Fly Flyknit Women’s Running Shoe!

I purchased for travel when I want stylish but comfortable walking shoes."
Nike,Zoom Fly Flyknit Women's Running Shoe,B07HYSKHFZ,RFZUYY05OO0NA,"January 12, 2020",4,Love the shoe not the color.,I love these shoes. I have 3 pair. I just didn't like this color. The pink is fluorescent pink. And the heel is kind a blue tint. Didn't like.the color combo. But love the shoe. Wish there was as many colors in the womens as men's.
Nike,Zoom Fly Flyknit Women's Running Shoe,B07HYSKHFZ,R2UC2DEZDFBINJ,"February 18, 2020",5,Most comfortable shoe ever!,"My son told me about this shoe and showed my husband and me his pair. We both ordered a pair, then I ordered a 2nd pair. It puts a spring in my step...I am in my 60s. I don't run but it makes walking inside and outside a real pleasure. I had difficulty finding a supportive shoe that doesn't flex in the arch. This is it!"

Nike,Women's's Air Huarache Run Shoes,B01A5ZP3AQ,R26J3X2J36LL6L,"July 20, 2018",4,Pretty Comfy,"These are pretty well-rounded sneakers. They look good, are nice and supportive around the ankle, and have arch support. I haven’t taken them on a run yet, but I’m guessing that they’d do well due to their light weight. As far as sizing, yes you should go up about a half size. I’m an 8, and the 8.5 fits well. I can feel the front of the shoe on my toes a little, but not uncomfortably so. I suppose if that would bother you, you could go a whole size up. The toe area is really big and I can wiggle my toes easily. I wore them for a day and could feel them breaking in and stretching out, so for me, a whole size up would not be an option. I’ve worn them with thin socks, thick socks, and barefoot. All ways were similar in comfort, but I preferred my thick ankle socks most because of the extra cushion. Hope this review helps someone. (Deducted one star because the bottom of one of my feet began to hurt after standing for a long time, but I will add the extra star if the issue subsides)."
Nike,Women's's Air Huarache Run Shoes,B01A5ZP3AQ,R2DBI5FYBSF71Z,"January 19, 2019",4,VERY Small,"I had to return these bc I could not get them on my foot - I bought a 10 and I’m a 9.5, on the slightly narrow side. Very sad bc they look super cushiony and cool!"

But returned them the same day. As soon as I opened the box I could tell immediately they were WAY too small. I even bought a whole size up because other reviewers suggested it. I wear a boys 6. I bought 7. They seemed like a 5. Try these on on store before coming home to purchase.
Nike,Women's's Air Huarache Run Shoes,B01A5ZP3AQ,RN8W9XI2EC8HG,"March 11, 2017",5,PICK A SIZE BIGGER!,Even though I bought a size bigger it looks fit somewhat small but it still fits me. I would recommend buying a size bigger if you are unsure of what size to choose but overall its great pair.

The only downside of these shoes even though they are comfortable, they are made of textile material and not real leather. My feet are sensitive to textile materials so I can only wear them occasionally. I sure miss the days when tennis shoes were made of actual leather and not cloth and other stuff."
Nike,Women's's Air Huarache Run Shoes,B01A5ZP3AQ,RTDFMZE9ZDDI5,"March 24, 2017",3,Size runs too small,"Honestly just go up 1 size. I read the reviews and still got my regular size. Then I had to order half a size bigger, yet still too tight from the front. Now I have to return both shoes and get a size 8 instead of my regular size. Overall, shoes look great and even though I went up a size, it still looks tiny on your feet. No need to worry about looking like a clown."

Unlike the earlier version that was very tight, this version is looser and you do not need to order 1/2 to a full size larger (they are true to size).

They look like a 3 than a 5.5. The width was way too narrow and tight and I am a 5.5 in sneakers. I'm going to get my money back!!

My second pair of huaraches but my first with this new design. At first the shoes are snug (as expected) but after wearing them for one day they are fine. I ordered my regular size & they’re fine. My only complaint is that the back of shoes ripped on my first pair within 6 months of having them - I am hoping the new design holds up better.
Nike,Air Huarache Running Shoe,B075Z51WMP,RZRKDDFIHXG9G,"June 17, 2019",3,A little small,Kinda small but overall good
Nike,Women's Air Max Motion LW Running Shoes,B0145Y5G4Q,R3NZET8PJ8NHV4,"October 27, 2018",5,Great support for high arches,Love this product. This is actually my second pair of the same exact model with Nike. The first pair being all platinum white. They lasted a good 10 months and I workout 6 days a week on average. Mostly indoors. I noticed when I took these outside they wore out abnormally fast. I had different sneakers for walking/ hiking/ running but honestly wanted to test these out because the fit was better than any shoe I ever owned (even more expensive ones). These are hard to find in store anymore and I believe they are coming out with a new set of colors to this make but I also wanted the black so I’m glad I found this online. Very happy with my purchase.
Nike,Women's Air Max Motion LW Running Shoes,B0145Y5G4Q,RB6F0XYLO2USZ,"March 13, 2018",2,These shoes are very comfortable. The bottom of my feet don't hurt,I average 3 to 4 miles per day at my job so I need a shoe that won't hurt my feet.  These shoes are very comfortable.  The bottom of my feet don't hurt.  I have fallen arches so these do help a lot.  I always get a larger size because I don't like my toenails crushed.  The only problem is that the top of the shoe (around the dorsal area) is tight. I still wear the shoes to work.  I'm hoping in time they will loosen up.
Nike,Women's Air Max Motion LW Running Shoes,B0145Y5G4Q,R122L2KGFMHQ33,"July 23, 2019",3,Nope. My poor feet.,"This is the second pair of these exact shoes that I have owned. The first pair was purchased in a store. This pair from Amazon tore up my feet after one light run. I am fairly certain that they one of the air pods is lower than the other, which I felt snapping/crackling as I used them. After wearing them in, I ended up with ganglion cysts on the base of both of my ankles. Because of the cysts, I had to lace the shoes loose, which caused deep blisters on the backs of my ankles. I also killed 2 of my toenails because these run about ½ size smaller than my last pair and these haven't stretched a bit. My feet now look and feel like crap, thanks to these shoes. There is no way they aren't defective or possibly even knockoffs because my last pair lasted over a year of DAILY running with only a teeny hole on the side. I am really upset that I wasted so much on these."

They arrived and fit well. I went up from my usual 7.5 to an 8 and I’m glad. I have a bunion on one side and it hasn’t hurt at all. The mesh upper is flexible and breathes well. Have used them for walking for a few hours and Body Pump but not gone running yet.

Nike,Women's Air Max Motion LW Running Shoes,B0145Y5G4Q,R3AMDWMEXMPS85,"June 8, 2018",4,Color is off,"I had bought the same pair of shoes from a retail store for my gym shoes. I liked them so much that i wanted another pair to wear for every day. I finally found my size in them on Amazon & ordered them. To compare them to the other pair, or anything else that is black, the pair from Amazon looks like a deep hunter green color. I don't understand how or why the color is off, but it's definitely noticeable if they are worn with black pants!"
Nike,Women's Air Max Motion LW Running Shoes,B0145Y5G4Q,R36OGSQMV0BR2T,"March 23, 2019",3,Might run a little small,"These Nikes fit perfectly, which leads me to believe they may run a little small as I tend to buy a 1/2 size larger in shoes I wear to work.  I like the design of the toe box, it's a more squared off toe, but I was expecting them to be more comfortable.  They are not as cushioned as I thought they would be.  I'm hoping they will feel softer after they are worn a few times."
Nike,Women's Air Max Motion LW Running Shoes,B0145Y5G4Q,R3O6NHR54AH9ZB,"August 24, 2019",4,Really like this shoe,"I really like this Nike tennis shoe. I wish it had a little more arch support - it does offer some, but if you have a higher arch like I do, it might not be enough for you. But I've worn it all summer and had good results. I get a lot of compliments on the look of the shoe too. It's a basic black with the white swoosh, but I love that it doesn't show dirt like all of my white Nikes have. So despite the OK arch support, I'd still recommend for anyone who needs a good walking shoe."

Nike,Women's Air Max Motion LW Running Shoes,B0145Y5G4Q,R3K7L6DJEEUHKD,"April 19, 2018",2,What happened to Nike?,"Nike quality has plummeted. Too lightweight, mesh seems thin and like the shoes would tear easily and look well-worn very quickly. Prices too high for the lousy materials and construction. $70 is just too much for these. Half the price would be about right and that's pushing it."

Nike,Women's Air Max Motion LW Running Shoes,B0145Y5G4Q,R11Y03888Y8HVG,"April 23, 2019",5,Amazing color and sizing.,I had bought a pair of Nikes when I was 11 and I could lot find the exact color till this pair. I don’t think they will last almost 9 years like my first pair. But it was so exciting to see a similar shoe to the very first ones I had ever bought. I have always wore the same size in Nike. If you know your size for this brand it makes it so easy to purchase from the internet.  These are true Nikes
Nike,Women's Air Max Motion LW Running Shoes,B0145Y5G4Q,R1IVTEAPQ1D84M,"March 15, 2017",3,Ankle biters,"The shoes themselves were comfortable, however the backs of the heels rubbed on my skin so bad both of my ankles were bleeding.  I wasn't going to wear tall socks or bandaids every time I wore them so I had to return them."

I had to order another style of Nike shoe for me (Nike Flynit), and the are great."
Nike,Women's Air Max Sequent 4 Running Shoes,B07BTQ2S68,RTZW8SOM8T6ZC,"May 31, 2019",3,"Review based on company, not product.","This review is strictly for the company that sent the shoes. The Air Max Sequents are just as pictured and described; love them. But, the company basically threw a pre-owned pair of shoes into the box without any of the stuffing. While it’s not terrible, the bottom of the soles have visible dirt as though someone wore them out and about. One shoe is more visible than the other, but it’s disappointing when you spend a fair amount of money on shoes to not receive a brand new pair."

I prefer comfort over everything else, so stuck to my champions I've had for 5 years. These Nike's still aren't as comfortable, though maybe with time worn in they will be. They are nice sneakers. Good support. Hopefully the stiffness relaxes."

Noticed a few things they run a littler small, so if you have a wide foot or a big arch be aware.  The fabric has some play buy not as much. The tongue is totally loose not connected inside and very thin so when you put the shoe on you are having to fight it to make sure it stays in place and doesn't bundled up."
Nike,Mens React Element 55 Running Shoes,B003ZTKHZ6,R2ZKXLITMTZ2G4,"July 8, 2019",5,Really good pair of shoes,"Design of this shoes is really stylish and minimalist, I loved their looking. Sofness of the sole is really really cool and confortable.

Nike,Mens React Element 55 Running Shoes,B003ZTKHZ6,R3MZQWAHDMV78C,"December 23, 2019",1,Terrible running shoe,Only positive I have is that it has plenty of support. The product took weeks longer to arrive than promised. The heel is made of some stiff material similar to rock climbing shoes. This makes the shoe awful to run in and prone to giving blisters. The tongue is a flimsy material that bends and folds over itself when the shoe is tied so it distributed pressure unevenly on the top of the foot. This thing is just impractical as a running shoe.
Nike,Mens React Element 55 Running Shoes,B003ZTKHZ6,R267RUTXV6E5ZT,"September 16, 2019",1,No two Nike shoes fit the same....,"I’m usually a big Nike fan but none of their shoes fit the same. First of all, the 11.5 and the 12 were both too small (I usually wear a 11.5) The shoes are super narrow in the toe box, the construction of the shoe felt cheap and the material at the ankle is way too high and way too thin. I could feel the shoe starting to wear into the skin above my ankle just while checking size in the house. Too bad as it’s a great looking shoe but just not a great shoe"
Nike,Mens React Element 55 Running Shoes,B003ZTKHZ6,R3PKRSJEV8NJ1D,"June 16, 2019",5,Excellent Sneakers!,"Nice cushioned insole and footbed. Lots of cushioning on your heel at an angle, which helps for walking uphill."

They are sleeker than an Air Force 1 which is nice when called for. These will crease pretty good so you may want to use a type of crease preventer. I wear a size 12 in most Nike and Jordan's but I had to size down to an 11.5 in these. I may have been able to go down to 11, but the 11.5 I felt were a good fit.

I have been look for some ok shoes to use at the gym and time after time I have not found any until I came across these great shoes. Forget about having any more runner shin for me or discomfort on my knees. I've bought shoe soles and nothing. I have get through my cardio with no pain and I am glad I can."
Nike,Men's Flex RN 2019 Running Shoe,B07H97YFGS,R1FJFNC0SR9HKJ,"August 28, 2019",5,These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.,I did buy 1 size up because I had tried them on previously. Much better fit if you have a wider foot since the toe box is not pointy like most shoes. Love these.
Nike,Men's Flex RN 2019 Running Shoe,B07H97YFGS,R1HMYTUFLQBQII,"January 27, 2020",3,Quality shoe but photo is misleading,"Just an FYI, these shoes have laces that need to be tied  ~~ the photo doesn’t show that the laces tie ~~ my son’s current pair of Nike Flex don’t have laces, just the decorative straps that look like laces, so we were surprised when these needed to be tied. Super easy to return though, and quick shipping."
Nike,Men's Flex RN 2019 Running Shoe,B07H97YFGS,R3IG6I3JPXAM23,"December 9, 2019",5,"Get these if you have tired, flat, achy feet.  Great","Fit my son perfect, my son is in Airforce and always wore Nike flex and similar styles before ASICS were ordered as part of his PT uniform.  My whole family has foot issues and this is the only brand/style we can wear comfortably.  Needless to say, he was relieved to get them today.  Recommended for people with flat feet, rolling ankles, knee surgeries, etc.  any of the lightweight thin sole Nike’s are a relief to these issues in my opinion."
Nike,Men's Flex RN 2019 Running Shoe,B07H97YFGS,R2B7OXYK6SKQ2A,"December 1, 2019",1,These do not have the band laces. The picture is misleading,The picture of the product is misleading as it shows the laces tucked in and looking like the original Nike flex 2019 shoes with rubber bands instead of the regular shoelaces. However these are just regular shoelaces the pattern on the shoes was different the cut of the shoes was very off and lopsided they didn't fit well at all and I highly doubt that they would fit well even if I bought a size and a half larger which is how small they seemed.. I cannot believe I wasted so much money on shoes that were extremely ugly and uncomfortable and not whatsoever what the picture looked like.

However this specific model runs large. I ordered the same size I wear on Nike’s but they are larger. They are just longer, the wide construction it’s ok. Gave them 4 stars because of that. As an advise try to buy half a size lower than what you wear on Nike other models."

I walk A LOT everyday. I choose to not own a car so i walk 4 to 8 miles a day on average. I have found these shoes to offer great support and cushion in all the right places.  I give them 5 stars without hesitation."

Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R3QGIKU7YYNITO,"August 27, 2018",5,Perfect,This is exactly what I was looking for. I have flat feet and it’s difficult finding a good pair of walking / working out shoes. Bought a 8.5 and they fit comfortably. Highly recommend.
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R1UV6T8OVY45C9,"July 11, 2018",1,Painful!!!,"These shoes are horrible. I have been running with Nike shoes for 15 years, and never had such a bad running experience. Super painful and way to narrow. Also, caused back pain because they don't absorb any of the shock. Will try to return, but since I already used them for a long (and painful) run, will probably just have to buy a different pair."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R2FR7Z8TS0M3TB,"December 27, 2018",1,Horrible,"Something is majorly wrong with these shoes!  I have always worn the same size in Nikes and these did not fit at all. Not even close to fitting!  My feet hung over the sides of the shoes and I don’t even have wide feet!  They were also very low cut.  An abnormal amount of my ankle socks were showing, it just looked strange. Thankfully I did not wear these outside, so I returned them!  I would not recommend anyone to order these. Something is fishy about them. I will never order another pair of Nikes."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R2E8UVIEG5CO30,"February 21, 2019",1,Would not recommend,"This shoe came as a real surprise to me. I've worn Nike shoes for many years now and I was really disappointed when I wore these. They have no support, it's like walking on the ground, and the arch seems to be off center. I feel like I was sold a defective shoe but only I wasn't, this was just how terrible this make of shoe is. Would not recommend."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R1R3CKUFYAI8OZ,"December 5, 2018",5,So comfy and what a great deal!,"I love how soft and comfortable these Nike's shoes are! Plus you can't beat the price, love my Prime BTW!  : ) Felt like I was wearing shoes that I have had for a long time. They felt great and I don't have to break them in. But they are a bit snog, so glad I got a size up. I usually wear a 6 or 6.5 shoes, but in sneakers it's 7.  I also had to loosen the shoelaces and once I did they were good to go. I wear them with ankle socks w/no problem of feeling like they are too tight. Over all they are exactly what I wanted and I can walk for miles!  : ) Thank you!"
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R21YXJR08667IT,"October 31, 2019",3,Not as good as the old flex run,I owned a pair of flex run shoes from 2013 and really loved them so I decided to purchase the new version as well. One of the best things about my 2013 pair was how wide the toe box was. I ordered the same size (7.5 wide) but it felt quite narrow. I’m hoping maybe as I wear them out more they will widen. The other thing was how hard and thin the sole is compared to the 2013 version. The balls of my feet got sore quickly but the shoe is not large/wide enough to fit an insert. I have to say I’m a bit disappointed. Overall these shoes are ok for treadmill walks or light jogs but nothing over 3 miles.
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,REEZLCTO69B7W,"May 5, 2019",1,Was not sure but after I got them I should have taken heed to the reviews.,These sneakers are completely off. They hurt my feet. They are small for a 6. I tried to loosen the lace all the way to maximize the space in the front to no avail. I concluded that the back is too short and does not fit in a way that is effective for walking. They are cute in terms of the colors.
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R3PRY2JYG4BS6S,"January 30, 2019",2,LOOK NICE - CHEAP QUALITY,"Shoes look nice but also a little cheap looking.  Being a Nike brand I was surprised of the cheap quality of these shoes.  Plus arch support is less in these shoes.  Disappointed, I am more use to a better quality of shoes from Nike."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,RMBWFZORGW820,"November 6, 2018",1,Oh My......,"Ordered size 8, always worn Nike sneakers, if you have flat wide feet  don't order. They are very narrow."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R2YLBHGKPQ9BTB,"February 4, 2019",1,Horrible representation of Wide Width,Nike's idea of a wide width shoe and mine are day and night apart. Even purchasing a half size bigger than my normal size made absolutely no difference.
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,RMP243OW5QC5T,"October 31, 2019",3,Not the same,I have been buying nike for years and the flex has been my go to! I work 5 nights a week for 12+ hour shifts as a nurses and they have never let me down... Until now. The toe box is more tapered than previous years. My feet swell a bit and the extra room saves me. It's a good shoe but keep that in mind when purchasing!
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R3FTMYFVEL8F7B,"November 27, 2018",2,Disappointed with the way my feet felt after the first two times wearing them.,"I am disappointed with the support in these shoes. The first day I wore them, my knees and feet just hurt. I tried putting arch supports in them today (even though I rarely use any kind of extra support in my shoes when I buy Nike shoes) and even with the extra supports, my knees still hurt. The shoes ran true to size but were not what I wanted when it came to all day wearability. Disappointed"
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R3BCKP7IHH46RV,"March 26, 2019",5,Great Nike quality,"True to size, very comfortable. The toe box is a little narrow so maybe you want to try a 1/2 size up if you are bothered by snugness in this area"
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R2NRKTFDILZN7W,"October 16, 2018",2,These run really small and have no padding.,"Every other pair of Nikes I own are a size 6.5, so that's what I ordered. These are super tight and I have a narrow foot, plus they're more like a size 6. I'd suggest ordering a 1/2 size up to be safe. But you'd also have to be OK with the fact that there's no padding or bounce to them. Not a very comfortable walking shoe IMO."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R2372UZMVQROU1,"May 6, 2019",4,Trying to contact seller,"The shoe is wonderful in terms of the look and craftsmanship. The only problem is that I need one size bigger. I purchased an 11 thinking this would be sufficient since it's my regular size, but found I need a larger size. Can anyone help. I love the shoe, just want a size larger."
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R34AR17I5ZSP7J,"February 11, 2019",5,Get your normal size,I ordered a half size up from seeing all the reviews and I wish I didn’t. They aren’t too much bigger so I’m keeping them but they are true to size. They are very comfy and light weight for running. The bottom of the shoe looks like they would be slippery but I haven’t had a problem with them and I’ve walked in the snow to the gym in them.
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R1KJ762U3NI4Y0,"March 18, 2019",5,Great looking shoe for the price,"I use these for work. I work in a dental office and need comfy shoes. These are not only very comfortable, but look gorgeous. I love them! I own a second pair that is pink. I use my second pair for the gym. Highly recommend! 5 Stars!"
Nike,Women's Flex Experience Run 7 Shoe,B0722W7YQ4,R1TBQ30VGI8TG2,"May 17, 2018",4,Cute and comfortable,"These shoes took a day to break in and felt more comfortable as I wore them. I bought them to hike some trails in, and they did their job really well. I love the color and get lots of compliments on them.  If you like Nike's, you know they run a bit small, and you'll like these ones."

Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R21QANBTTEWKJC,"January 19, 2016",5,MY NEW HOLY GRAIL WORK SHOE.,"I am a bartender with 15 years of experience, currently working in NYC, i work 4-5 days or nights (or combination thereof) per week, sometimes standing on my feet for 16 hours or more. I have had CHRONIC problems with my feet over the past few years- marble sized knots in the arches of both feet, excruciating to stand on, taking 30 minutes or more to get out of bed in the morning and walking like my feet are bird feet, all curled up at the arches. I was skeptical as hell to try anything like a simple sneaker to fix this. Mind you i have worn 20 eyelet doc martens since i was age 13, and i am now age 34.... so even though the sneaker is CUTE AS HELL and makes my size 10 foot look MUCH smaller than it is.... i was like, ""eh, not docs, not my thing but ill give it a shot bc the pain i am experiencing is TOO MUCH"". .... so far ive made it through 3 - 12 hour BUSY bar shifts (running around, really hustling, and both bars i work at are very long so i am covering a lot of area while working) - i give these FIVE STARS or MORE if i could. i have NEVER experienced a walk home after a long shift thinking ""wow... my feet actually feel... GOOD!!!!"" The arch support is wonderful, the scoop in the inner ankle area makes it so you dont have blisters or rubbing on your ankle, there is sufficient padding in the back of the shoe (no blisters on my heels), the sole is VERY good at keeping you from falling on your face (even on wooden slats that i have behind my one bar - milano's bar in nyc, one of the oldest in the city) and they are equally as good on modern rubber mats - allowing movement without sticking your foot in one place to twist your ankle, but giving you a very safe feeling that you will not be slipping even on wet beer or liquor soaked surfaces. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone in the service industry give this sneaker a try, for the price it is worth a shot, even if you arent experiencing horrific foot pain. LOVE THEM."
Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R35KV0B7N9AZ8X,"October 27, 2017",3,"After five days, a tear on the side","I work in a restaurant kitchen as a pastry cook, with all the pastries and desserts—so it doesn’t get as crazy as the hot kitchen does in terms of working areas. These shoes arrived on oct 19, but I didn’t start wearing them until two days later because I was off work—so I’ve been wearing them less than a week, and I only wear them when I’m at work, I haven’t used them for anything else in the five work days I’ve used them on.  I also haven’t tripped or skid or bumped into anything or anyone to warrant this tear on the side that I saw when I put on my shoes this morning. Which leads me to the conclusion that i guess these just aren’t made properly. I’m going to see if I’m able to exchange these but I doubt it..now I’m going to spend who knows how much money for these to be repaired (I don’t think I want to use super glue on these). And I just spent over $50 on them too. They’re incredibly comfortable though, they fit great (I’m a 8.5 in other shoes but when Skechers I wear 9) and they look bulky but they’re light on the feet and I do love how they feel—I’ve worn Skechers casual shoes and sneakers for years and I’m a fan. These work shoes seem to be non-slip for sure, the soles are nice and thick..it’s just those seams on the side. That’s the only reason why I gave this a 3..otherwise 5 all the way"
Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R1LJD1MGAK9GNP,"January 8, 2016",4,Desperate for comfortable work shoes... Pleasantly surprised.,"I almost couldn't walk when I got home from work after 8 hours on my feet on concrete. Once I get home it felt like my feet won't even support me, and I would practically crawl to the house after the drive home. I would have to take several extra strength pain relievers and go to bed. Both of my feet have had broken bones by an podiatrist when I was young to narrow my feet and I have had problems every since. I also have flat feet. I bought these shoes as the best I could afford with slight hope that they would help. To my pleasant surprise I was able to work on them for 10.5 hours the first day and no swelling. I did not have to rock from one foot to the other to relieve the pain so my hips felt better, and my shins didn't burn like normal. You can take out the insert out if you need a very deep shoe, but much softer with it left in. I thought it would bother me but it didn't after I loosened the laces as far as they would go, and there was no pressure on the bones on the top of my foot. I guess the only thing I would say is that the arch support is slightly less than needed but I am currently just so grateful that I have some immediate relief. They aren't perfect but better than most, and affordable. Keeping in mind I have flat feet with lots of issues and past surgery. I hope this helps."
Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R2J3DDENG4PIX,"January 10, 2018",5,First let me say it is the most fantastic shoe I have ever worn,"This shoe has so many positive things to say about, I hardly know where to start.  First let me say it is the most fantastic shoe I have ever worn.  I work in the restaurant business and I have never had a more comfortable and supportive shoe than this one. They literally massage my feet all day long. There is a memory foam pad that fits under the base of my toes and it's so comfortable.  My back hasn't bothered me or my legs since I started wearing them.  I ordered two more pairs for people I work with and they were just as excited as I have been. Please do your feet a favor and purchase a pair of these shoes. I hope I will be able to buy them in the future, they are the best work shoe I have ever owned."
Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R15G13FTTMJQ5N,"February 16, 2015",5,I love these shoes,I love these shoes.. I work at a restaurant in the Kitchen so I am on my feet a ton. I had payless shoes and after the first day of work I couldn't walk my husband had to carry me to the bedroom. My heel always hurt... I work 37-45 hours a week. I also have a 10 month old so I am constantly on my feet. These shoes have stopped my heel pain and I can walk fine. The memory foam feels amazing. I fell in love with these shoes
Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R1Z4AFZZ0WRUQO,"December 31, 2016",5,THE BEST OF THE BEST!!!,"These non-skid work shoes are the best out there and they run true to size! I am a waitress in a large restaurant, so I do a few miles of walking a day and have tried all the name brand work shoes, but none have given my feet the quality of COMFORT and SAFETY PROTECTION from slipping as these SKETCHERS. I read the reviews on all the choices of top work shoes carefully before making this purchase and have to agree with all of those who recommended these unbelievably great work shoes. They make you feel like you're walking on a cloud! FYI - I added a pair of insole pads to add even more cushioning and they will also make your shoes last longer, but these shoes do have their own extra pillow of cushioning as well to soothe your tired feet as you walk!!!"
Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R11YDDDJ61JCOU,"March 23, 2017",1,My shoe fell apart!,Unfortunately I had to edit my review of the sketchers. After 4 months they are coming apart at the seems. I never had a shoe come apart at the stitching.
Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R3FRGI94J25YIT,"March 9, 2017",5,Extremely comfortable & lightweight!,I wear these for hospital cafeteria work.  They are extremely comfortable and very light weight.  Sketchers has a beefier model that I have bought before which would be good for standing on your feet for 10 hr days.  Right now these are being used for 4/5 hr shifts.  No break in time what so ever.  Comfortable right out of box.
Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R3K5AV9RHFR0MO,"July 1, 2016",4,... 3 days but have found them to be surprisingly comfortable. I work in sales and find myself standing ...,"I have only been wearing these shoes for 3 days but have found them to be surprisingly comfortable.  I work in sales and find myself standing 90% of the day on concrete floors and in greasy areas of grocery stores (prep. area in the deli mainly).  They seem to deliver on the slip resistant area which is as important as cushion for all day standing.  I have purchased several other pairs of shoes over the years for the same line of work, or at least standing on my feet all day and for the price find these to be a good value.  Only time will tell how long they last or remain comfortable, this will determine if I purchase again or continue to seek better brand. Okay, I've had these for a few months now and still find them to be very comfortable.  I will say that they are a ""hot"" shoe, maybe it's because I live in AZ but during the day sometimes I find my feet roasting (and I am generally someone that is always cold)."
Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R3OMHIP6QAL7H2,"February 13, 2018",3,Not For Heavy Duty Purposes,"I don’t like the fact that I’m giving this a 3 star review. While they are comfortable and do not hurt your feet when breaking them in, they do not last long which is not so good for how much they cost. I work in a place where I’m on my feet 10 hours a day 5 days a week and my right shoe sole is starting to come off. I bought these back in January of 2018 and it is now February. I’m looking for heavy duty comfortable working shoes that will last much longer. I had high hopes for these shoes since they have a 4.4 out of 5 stars. They’re great! Just not for heavy duty purposes."

The heels of my feet hurt the whole time at work and even when I would get home. Like the other reviews, some days I would drag myself into my house and want to cry because of the pain. I took the chance on these shoes. I don't really like buying shoes that I don't try on first, but I just don't have the time to go shoe shopping around town. So I took a chance and used them for the first time at work. They are great!!  I have always had problems with finding the right shoe that fits with comfort. I have a bunion on my right foot. I purchased  the 7 1/2 E.  All I can say it is wonderful not having pain when I get home or during my work shift. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because they are not the most attractive shoes."

Scholls, but after going through 3 pairs in 6 months at $30 a pair, I figured a little investment might actually save some money. These were the best reviewed women's nonslip and OH MY GOD are they comfy. I mean, my feet still hurt after a shift, but I don't notice it till I stop running. The memory foam is so comfy, it's like stepping on a pillow. Great support, too. I used to wear inserts, but haven't needed to with theseveral awesome beasts! 9 months later, and I'm still going on my first pair. The heels have worn a little on the inside from my foot rubbing on the back, but other than that, they show no signs of quittin any time soon. I LOVE these shoes. They are totally worth the investment."

After owning a slightly different version of Skechers  , I decided to try these with the flatter, less articulated sole. These are equally as comfortable and well made as my other Skechers' shoes.  The gel sole in this model is removable, so anyone who prefers their own orthotics will have no problem fitting them into this model.  They appear to be as equally durable as my other Skechers (link above). With a leather upper and non-skid sole, these are safe and comfort plus all day long.  These Skechers have no safety toes, just in case someone wanted to know. Thank you, Skechers, for making the most comfortable and durable all around shoes on the planet."

I tried Danskos, but couldn't seem to get them to break in. So as I was searching the web, I came across these Sketchers. I've been wearing them for a week now and absolutely love them.

I'm very impressed with this shoe.  I especially like the arch support I get as I need it.  They also have a very comfortable step as I'm on my feet 8-10 hours per shift.  As I wear these over time, I will post an update as that is the information I look for when reading reviews.  And the best part is that I paid about a third of what I have for other shoes.  Even if I have to buy 3 pairs a year, it's worth it to have something that feels good on my feet. UPDATE.......after one month of wearing these, I wouldn't change a thing!  They were comfortable the entire first night I wore them even though I brought my old ones along to change out after part of the night.  This is the first shoe I've owned I could wear the first time and not suffer from blisters or other problems from a brand new shoe.  I love the arch support and they help these ol' feet get through an 8-10 hour shift just fine.  There are several other work shoes sitting in my closet now I don't plan to wear again.  I hope I will always be able to find this shoe when it comes time to replace them.  Also, I have a big wide foot with bunions and these still work wonderfully well for my feet.  I hope this helps someone else looking for a comfortable shoe!"
Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R3BDCFYP2LZGBI,"March 23, 2018",5,"If you bartend, you NEED these shoes!","I am a bartender that works long shifts that are high pace. I was originally wearing combat boots that were worn and super uncomfortable. At the end of a shift, my legs would be in pain and I could barely walk. I did a lot of research to find the best shoes for bartending and came across these with amazing reviews. I wore them for a shift and they fit perfectly and were so comfortable. It felt like I was walking on a cloud. They are soft and I don't slip because of the tread on the bottom. These are SOOO cute and they look good with leggings. I never thought in a million years I would purchase Sketchers but now I am a fan. These are the best and I will be getting more pairs as the years go on."
Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R2FPN48M8F6G2Q,"March 30, 2017",5,Ten thumbs up!!!,I love these shoes! They arrived a couple of hours before I needed to wear them to start a new job in a grocery store Deli requiring none-slip shoes. I have very wide feet across the toes and have a terrible time finding shoes that fit--most often I buy men's shoes. I put these on and went to work. The Skechers were amazingly supportive and comfortable (and didn't slip once!) and got me through the worst work experience of my life. They are also affordable. I have ordered 2 casual pairs of Skechers now to try.
Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R1QRTVC26S2JLG,"March 5, 2018",5,Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride!,"I've always been a fan of Skechers. And as an adult, I've been experiencing plantar fasciitis/heel pain, and supination (I feel the need to walk on the outside of the soles of my feet, to be comfortable). I'm on my feet a LOT - I walk about two miles to work, and two back, 4 to 5 days of the week. I work in a restaurant, and depending on my shift, I'm on my feet anywhere from 4 to 8 hours. These shoes seemed like they'd give me the support my feet needed, and offer the Skechers comfort that I adore. I was able to try on my true shoe size (9.5 wide) at a local store; I figured that I should look at a 10 wide, and add an insert for extra heel support. As lovely as the memory foam in, it's not quite enough by itself. There was almost no break-in period. I got my inserts the same day as my shoes (I did try to wear them without the insoles, and I made the right choice for myself by adding the extra support), and WOW. These shoes give me a little bit of height, and I feel like I'm walking on a cloud. Because I ordered the next half-size up for me, it's a bit loose around the heel, but not enough to be unsafe or a bother. The slip-resistance has been lovely - I am not a naturally graceful person! - and while my foot issues remain, these shoes are definitely making long shifts on prep and at the register more bearable. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase; I did not expect these shoes to fix my foot issues, and I did expect to order my shoe a bit bigger to keep the original insole plus my support insole in the shoe. I love the comfort, and hope that these will last me for awhile!"

Skechers,Work Sure Track - Trickel,B00F57H8VC,R1HQCMGS31ZMK5,"March 17, 2015",4,"A few surprises, but a very well-made product.","I travel frequently for work and am always looking for packing accessories that make my life easier. These little tubs are fantastically designed. The original purpose for which I ordered them was to put cosmetics in (specifically my face moisturizer which is home-made). Upon first use, it leaked. I'm really glad I put it in a ziploc bag. So for liquidy items (my moisturizer, when warm, is like the consistency of oil), I would not recommend these. They are larger than I was expecting. Granted, I didn't pay super close attention to the dimensions listed when I purchased. I expected them to be about 1.5"" - 2""  in diameter. In reality, they are 3"" in diameter. I also expected that the material of the lid would be a softer silicone like the brand's travel sized bottles (for shampoo, conditioner, etc). They are instead a very hard plastic that seems incredibly durable. The shape of the lid and how it fits with the base (there is a slight lip at the top of the base) is what clicks the two together and makes the lid stay on. The product could be improved by putting a small rubber gasket either around the inside of the lid or at the top of the base rim to prevent leaking more effectively. I will find other uses for these tubs - or improve my recipe for home-made cosmetics. :) They truly are very well engineered and seem incredibly durable. This is, by far, the driest and most technical Amazon product review I've ever written."

They fit as expected, and I wore them only for work as a hospital pharmacy tech. They were pretty comfortable in the beginning, but the memory foam insoles thinned out quickly. I replaced them with different inserts just over a week after getting them. Unfortunately, I didn't even get a month out of them before they split down the side. Thankfully Amazon was awesome and refunded me, because $45 is too much for shoes that last less than a month. I have to say that I've been more and more disappointed with the Skechers brand, and I can confidently say I'm done buying them."

Nearing the end I thought there was something stuck to the bottom of the shoes.It turns out that it was the bottom of the shoe itself that was pealing off! 3 miles-you've got to be kidding me. Wow, I am so disappointed in the Skechers brand now. I have noticed that the quality of their shoes and boots have declined and that really bothers me since I have been a big Skechers fan for years."

I wear a size 5 and it's hard to find shoes in that size.  I figured the first few days might be a little uncomfortable until I would break them in, but to my surprise I have been wearing them  for two whole days and never had any problems. I love the air cushion insert.  Very comfortable!  And I really like the extra height. The only downside that I have about  my particular size 5 wide is that the colors are very limited.  It's either in black or beige.  I would love the cute colors!  I would highly recommend this for people who have problems with their walking ability also. Great orthopedic shoe  at a very reasonable price!"
Skechers,Women's D'Lites Memory Foam Lace-up Sneaker,B014GNJV6K,RX1R5IGWLH4M8,"April 10, 2017",2,Not for pronators,"I really wanted these to work; I've looked for a well-cushioned shoe for a long time. These shoes are very well cushioned and comfortable and I thought I finally found the ones. However, as soon as I started walking around in them, my knees began to hurt. I'm a pronator with bad knees, and these have no arch support whatsoever. The shoe does not have a removable insole, so there was no option to put in something more supportive. Sadly, I had to return them. I would, however, recommend these for anyone with normal feet and no knee or hip issues. They are light and as comfortable as a favorite pair of slippers."
Skechers,Women's D'Lites Memory Foam Lace-up Sneaker,B014GNJV6K,RJX5A22RKY5GI,"July 25, 2017",5,Would Buy Again,Great pair of tennis shoes.  Recently went through two rounds of chemo and my feet are numb - these shoes offer good support and they fit as expected.  My concern was finding a shoe that protected my feet which they do - nice sole that is NOT too thin.  And they are not that heavy but offer good protection - I have purchased another pair just for the gym and they do seem to stand up really well.  Will buy again just to have a back up pair.  About sizing - prior to chemo I was an 8-1/2 however now I take more care with my feet so a size 9 definitely feels very comfortable and they are not snug and don't fall off.  Hoping they continue to make these as it's hard to find good fitting shoes when your feet are numb!
Skechers,Women's D'Lites Memory Foam Lace-up Sneaker,B014GNJV6K,RRP6ZO1NGRHFJ,"November 23, 2018",4,Perfect fit for all feet,"I normally wear a size 8.5 & purchased the same size. These shoes were a perfect fit. I've worn Sketchers D'lites in the past, only in their black & white style. After 3 of the same pairs bought in a row, I wanted a different style. after years of wearing shoes that never fit quite right, I came back to what I know: Sketchers D'lites. I bought the grey pair & they look identical to the pictures shown in the original post. The reason for my giving ""perfect"" shoes 4 starts over 5, is the memory foam insert was inserted at an angle & as a result, it was wrinkled which wouldn't have been an issue if I couldn't feel it but I could so it was a problem. The inserts are pretty easy to remove so if you wear orthotics or just prefer your own inserts, these come out easy enough.  I was able to re-insert the inserts & after a couple of hours standing on them (I am a personal trainer at a gym & on my feet all day), the inserts laid a bit flatter but I can still feel where the wrinkle was. It's not disturbing how my feet feel, so it's not worth the return. Speaking of shipping, I have Amazon Prime & while these should have been received in 2 days, they were received in 4 days.  What I've found is if an order is placed before 12 noon Wednesday, products arrive within the 2 day window. Back to the shoes, they came laced up with white laces & an additional grey pair were included, which I've opted not to wear as the white ones seem to provide a better contrast, in my opinion. These shoes are great for literally, all feet widths. Most women at least know of the movie called, ""Sisterhood of Travelling Pants"". The base of the story is there is 1 pair of pants & 4 girlfriends. They all have different body styles but the 1 pair of pants fits them all perfectly. The same seems to be true of these shoes. I have narrow to average width feet while a co-worker has very wide feet. She went to a convention where another brand was featured & she came back with 2 pair as they were ""geared toward women w/wider feet"". I liked 1 pair well enough but not enough to buy them. I let her try on my D'lites & she was in love & literally said she was going to try to return the other 2 pair she bought & was definitely buying a pair of Sketchers D'lites. We agreed the Sketchers were far more comfortable. I prefer shoes that do not rub on my ankle bones on the sides. These are low enough around that bone that they never rub. I prefer shoes that don't rub on the back of ankle by my Achilles tendon. These are padded well & don't rub at all. I prefer shoes with a wider toe box so my toes are crunched together. These definitely have that.  I am indifferent to the memory foam. The first pair I bought several years ago didn't come with that so that wasn't something I was looking forward to. The problem with memory foam in shoes is, over time, the memory foam foes flat & is no longer cushy. When that time comes, because I tend to put a lot of miles on my shoes, I'll likely need another pair but in the event I don't, I'll slip in a pair of inserts. I am fond of a blue pair that come in a black box, but that is based on my unique gait. If you're looking for that ""perfect"" shoe, you have found it so search no more. simply choose your favorite color(s)."

I walk on concrete at work all day. My feet always hurt. These provide extra cushion with the memory foam insert. They fit comfortably as well. My one and only con is they dont  breath well. My feet are always hot. I transitioned to super thin socks and that helped. Over all I rate these a five of five stars.

I am a SOLID size 8 in shoes.  I loved them at first 'step'.......it was 1-2 hours into wearing them that areas all over the bottom of my feet would go completely numb and/or hurt.  Also.....it looks like it's missing a shoelace hole that secures the ankle better.  I loosened the shoelaces to make it better on the pads of my feet....but then it didn't hold me in the shoe.  If you are buying these just to look cute (which they are and Sketchers provides 2 sets of laces black&white which I loved) then great! If you are buying them to be active in them....I would not recommend.....
Skechers,Women's D'Lites Memory Foam Lace-up Sneaker,B014GNJV6K,R2XKJ4NL0749AL,"February 18, 2016",3,"A decent shoe overall, but these really do run small.","I was foolish not to pay closer attention to the people who insisted these shoes run small, and suggested new purchasers buy a half size up. Because a half size up was not available, I bought them anyway (the price was agreeable), and hoped that after wearing them for a while they would begin to conform to my foot. Sadly, after a week of wearing them three hours every morning the shoes have held fast, and my toes are suffering for it. Having measured these against other shoes in my closet, I do see that they are about a quarter of an inch (more or less) smaller than my current shoes, so perhaps it would have been wiser to buy a full size larger than what I generally wear. It seemed such a hassle to return them, so my hope that these will eventually work continues."

Not what they are supposed to be.,These Sketchers are not at all like the DeLites before the memory foam.  There isn't enough arch support in these and the foam is squishy.  My back was aching after 7 hours in these the very first time I wore them  In the former Delites my back never aches till they wear out usually after 6 or more months in my nursing job.  They aren't as comfortable to wear either.  Not going to be buying these again.  I've been buying and wearing Delites or the Sketchers very similar for more than 20 years.  These are not as good as the former ones.  I'm worried now about this Memory Foam turning hard as foam does along with the shoe not having any real support right from the GetGo.

I have foot problems and my foot pain is always alleviated when I put on my Skechers. Not the case with these.  I guess it's the memory foam that makes them so ill-fitting as my other pairs did not have memory foam.  These are awful.  My previous Skechers always felt significant...like I had a nice solid shoe with great arch support.  These feel skimpy, like they're not fully on my feet...and arch support is non-existent."

Tried them on and walked around the house and they felt good. The next day, I wore them for a 12 hour shift at work and by the 2nd hour, my feet hurt so bad I wanted to cry.

I love the 3d sizing recommendations.  It helps you to find your perfect size based on questions you answer and feedback from other customers about sizing.  Also, your info is saved for later use if you want to buy shoes at a later date.  As for this shoe specifically, I LOVE IT!!  I recently had surgery on my foot and was told that I needed to transition to wearing an orthopedic shoe for 3 months.  I wasn't to crazy about spending $100+ on shoes I would only wear for a few months.  In my quest for an alternative I came across this shoe.  Its very lightweight and has great arch support with air-cooled memory foam. YAY, no sweaty feet!!  It also has a very sturdy sole AND they are super cute. I showed them to my podiatrist and she approved.  On my next visit 3 weeks later, she was wearing a pair. I am in these shoes everyday and they fit & feel great. I will be buying another pair in a different color."

I have purchased ...,"These Skechers D'Lites  must be counterfeit?  I have purchased at least a dozen pairs of Skechers brand clog sneakers over the last decade, including numerous D'Lites style (I typically buy about 1 of those a year). I always buy a woman's size 8, and they always fit me perfectly. I bought this shoe to replace a couple pairs of D'Lites that were starting to look old. Unfortunately, I neglected to try them on right away, never assuming there could be a problem. About a month later I took them out of the box, and was shocked to find that they were GIGANTIC. I feared that they had sent me a Men's size shoe instead of a Woman's, but checking the shoe & box, that was not the case. This shoe is a Wide (which I have purchased before and normally fits fine). but the Length of this new shoe is much much longer than a normal Skechers woman's size 8. I am attaching photos to show the difference between this new shoe and several of my older Skechers of the same size. (I apologize for how shabby some of the older shoes look - I save old worn shoes to work in cement/paint/mud etc. I didn't have a cleaner pair to show the difference in the sole of the similar D'Lite shoes) These new (counterfeit?)  shoes are worthless to me. Even if I wore double socks to fill up the shoe, the tongue is so long it cuts into the front of my ankle. The option to return them had passed, so I am stuck with them at this point.

Skechers,Sport Women's D'Lites Slip-On Mule Sneaker,B014GMZBJC,RJBS2LFBYJN1A,"August 30, 2016",5,VERY Comfortable - Runs Large,"I normally wear a size 6.5 but over the past few years I've had to go up to a size 7. As I've gotten older I guess my feet are getting wider, so most shoes in my ""normal"" size are too tight, and not too many places offer a Wide size. I love the ""Mule"" style as I am 100% disabled and it's getting hard for me to always bend over and tie my shoes, or re-tie them when they come undone. I also love a totally white sneaker as white goes with anything. I have other shoes in different colors, but white is a necessity! These shoes are extremely comfortable. I can put them on in the morning or around lunch time and wear them until after dinner or right before bed and my feet do not hurt. I won't say I have flat feet but they're close, and I had to wear things in my shoes when I was younger because I had knock knees and I walked on the arch of my foot. Not to mention I broke my neck and back...so I  have to be careful of the shoes I wear. These are perfect! I can wear these with or without socks, and they feel just as good either way. I can say, however, that these DO run large...I would say half a size maybe? I could have gotten away with getting a 6.5 wide and they would have been fine, but I don't know if I could have worn socks comfortably. In the summer, here in Central Texas where it's Bloody HOT - no socks is not a big deal. But it does get a little cold here in January/February, so I would want to wear socks. So sizing will probably be a small issue. Order accordingly. I love these Skechers mules and would definitely recommend!"
Skechers,Sport Women's D'Lites Slip-On Mule Sneaker,B014GMZBJC,RA6U3K82A0PPT,"May 4, 2017",4,stable and supportive despite being backless; just ordered 2nd pair,"I bought these because I developed a bone spur on the back of my heel and need backless walking shoes. I have a high arch/high instep and need something stable. I tried on a lot of shoes locally and couldn't find anything that accommodated my high instep and didn't fall off when I tried to walk in them. These work pretty well. When I first tried them on, the tongue stuck out and was irritating, but the leather uppers have conformed well to my foot and were comfortable pretty soon. The insole was flat, so I ripped it out and put in Superfeet insoles. The original insole is foam and was glued in, so it was a pain to remove; I prefer shoes to have easily replaceable insoles. Previously I wore Brooks running shoes for walking, and they were more cushioned but they also cost more than twice as much. These are remarkably stable for a backless shoe. The heel is higher than my running shoes, which is good because it helps keep my feet in the shoes when I walk. It's also helpful for my Achilles, which is irritated by the spur. I initially bought a 9.5 as that's the size I normally wear. They were too big; the size 9 fits well. Update 12/28/17: I've been wearing these shoes for 8 months now, and they are doing great. I just ordered my second pair. The stiffness in the tongue was gone long ago and they're very comfortable. I'm leaving my 4-star review instead of increasing it to 5, only because of the glued-in insole."
Skechers,Sport Women's D'Lites Slip-On Mule Sneaker,B014GMZBJC,R2UPXSV1ECJU4J,"October 3, 2017",5,"Slip on, but DO have laces!","I ordered theses to replace my old D'Lites, and I thought these were the same as my old ones, but these DO have laces. My old ones didn't- another reviewer posted pics on this item that look like the ones I had and thought I was buying. However, they also ARE still slip ons- once you tie the laces up, you never need to untie them again. At first I was a little put off by it, but then I realized that not only does it look better, I can adjust how tightly or loosely the actual body of the shoe fits. One thing about the old style is over time, it would stretch out and not fit as well- this won't be a problem with this style. So while at first I didn't think I'd like them, I am glad that I didn't realize this when I ordered, because I probably wouldn't have purchased them if I had. So I am very happy with these shoes, but I do think they should make it more clear in the photos that these shoes do have laces in them. They come with both white and blue laces."

I love how bright they are and the silver detail really sparkles.  We live in the country and I always need a pair of shoes to slip on to go to the barn or take out the trash, these slip on sneakers are the best for trekking around the yard. I have always owned New Balance in the past but they have stopped making the style I like and they are so expensive. I decided to try the Skechers and I am not disappointed. I order the wide width because I find these types of shoes tend to be narrow. I don't wear wide width in any other shoes I buy.  I also recommend buying the largest size you wear in any footwear. I wear a 9.5 rarely in a shoe, but always in a boot. I order these in a 9.5 and they fit perfectly. Your heel will come down right on the lip at the back of the shoe if you get them too small and that is very uncomfortable. The shoe will never get loose enough or big enough to make your foot slide forward and get off that ridge, so make sure you get a big enough size. I slip these on when I have to drive my daughter to practice and I do find that when they get really worn and loose on your foot, I am a little uncomfortable driving in them. Maybe I place my foot weird on the accelerator but my foot tends to slide out of the shoe, so these are not my favorite driving shoes. I bought them for a good fitting easy slip on shoe with good support and they definitely make me very happy!"
Skechers,Sport Women's D'Lites Slip-On Mule Sneaker,B014GMZBJC,R18Z0SYW50LD4V,"March 26, 2017",5,Super Comfortable!!!,"Sometimes you just need a shoe you can quickly get onto your feet and it not be a slipper (like when you realize you forgot to get the trash cans to the street and you hear the truck roaring towards your house). These shoes fit the bill for sure, but they are definitely comfortable enough to walk around in all day. I love the slip-on aspect, when it's hot but you need more than a sandal, these shoes work really well. We spent a lot of time at the beach in late afternoon evening walking and exploring and I love that I can dip my feet into the water, walk on the sand and then brush them off and slip on my shoes to walk on the rocks."

I probably could have ordered a half size up. I typically wear a size 8-1/2 and that is what I ordered; however, the 9 might have fit better. I sometimes feel like my heel is stepping on the back of the shoe and not fitting inside; however, it also feels like there is more room in the toe section. If I ""shove"" my foot inside the shoe more, than I have a little more room for the heel. In other words, instead of just slipping into these, I need to force my toes to the top of the shoe. I think these make my feet look huge. The front and top of the shoe is higher and wider making my feet look wide. Still cute, but some might not like that."

The D'lites line has always been my favorite ""shape"" for a tennis shoe / mule.  I've always liked the way the shoe rides up higher on my instep than other mules.  However, the addition of memory foam to the sole and making the tops out of plastic has cheapened the shoes beyond redemption.  It is apparent within minutes of donning the shoes that the plastic uppers makes the shoes too hot to wear for very long.  I've worn these only once and found myself slipping my feet out of the shoes whenever I could just to cool them down.  And the memory foam may feel comfortable for a very short time, but seems to flatten out and lose it's comfort value in a short period of time.  As far as the size, I think I'm in a middle category… B width is too slim and C/D is too wide.  And the length seems to be the same story, too short or too long.  I recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable shoe, do not buy this version."

They are most comfortable but, but.....I walk out of them and actually fell because of it. My foot slides out when touching the gas or brake pedals. My own fault, I didn't notice there was no back at all. So I would like suggestions on what I can do to add something to be able to wear these shoes. I bought two pairs, not knowing what I thought was black was blue on one but when I wished to exchange I was told to keep the blue ones so you can see this company is the best in Cutstomer Service. Now if someone can come up with a clue how to add something so my foot remains in shoe....I actually fell walking out of them when entering someone's house. Other than my mistake...these shoes are great but remember, they have NO back at all, more designed like slippers. Help please.....if seller is reading this, is it too late  to return all three pairs to you for credit? I have three pairs of excellent, for others, shoes sitting unused in my closet. Or if you sell regular shoes with high back would you be willing to exchange the black and the white pairs? I will still return all three if you agree. I need new shoes desperately so please let me know if anything can be done. I understand if you cannot help me."

I have worn a slightly different pair of Skechers every year. This year I decided to try a different color. The blue sneaks arrived and the fit was not quite as good from day one. They went into high rotation at the end of August with the beginning of the school year, but I have not worn them nearly as often as I did my white ones because the fit was not as good and they were just not comfortable. Not even 6 months into my school year and these are trashed. The insole is about 40% gone and I am walking on the sole and killing my feet. I would not recommend these if you need a sturdy pair that will last. My other Skechers have all lasted at least one school year and with much more use than these have seen."

They were comfortable and a fave, and were fashionable with white and pink (apparently not available anymore).  I haven't been buying shoes very much, and usually wear just one or two over and over until they fail or wear out.  I'm glad Amazon has these shoes for sale and that I found them, b/c they're a favorite of mine, very comfortable, easy-on/easy-off, and have a rugged sole. Unlike the 1st pair I ordered years ago, these current-model Bright Sky Fashion Sneakers have an added bonus:  Air-Cooled Memory Foam Insoles -- making them even more comfortable than the shoes from years ago !  I believe the foam insole also accentuates and improves the fit.  This buy could only be made better if Amazon lowered the price by 25 - 30%. . . that would be Perfect !!"

I tend to need a 9 in non-wide shoes. They are very comfortable but just a little too big. They slide off my feet a bit as a walk, but not so much that I’ll return them. The only other problem I have with them is that they’re a bit chunky and “elderly” looking. A slightly thinner and less chunky/round toe would go a long way to make them look more stylish. I will compliment them on how lightweight they are for how chunky they look though. I’m a nurse,  and I’m on my feet on a busy floor for 12.5 hrs a night. And these are much better than my awful, torturous Danskos. Plus they’re easy to slide off for a quick lunch break nap or foot stretch. So I do like them, but they could be improved. Likely won’t buy another pair once these wear down to be honest. Still on the hunt for the perfect Mix of style and comfort for a nurse with plantar fasciitis."

Very Comfy and Super Cute, I can just slide them on and go! I’ve also gotten loads of compliments from all of my Peeps in Physical Therapy! I’m not sure why the stores here stopped carrying them, but I’m extremely happy that Amazon does! And not only were they on sale, I had enough Points from my Amazon Chase Card so the second pair was a Freebie!

I have walked the stairs, gone outside and walked my one acre yard, hung clothes out to dry and felt AWESOME. The only slip on shoes that ever worked were expensive Keens.

This info re sizing might be helpful.  My feet measure 9.5"" long x 3.5"" wide.  One shoe chart on internet says 9.5 length is size 8 and 3.5"" is is M for size 7.5. The 8W I ordered first because I usually that wear in other tennis-type comfort shoes were huge on me in this shoe.  Long story short: Size 7M fit me perfectly.

These work ok as slippers (nice cushioned footbed) and with athletic socks.  I bought them as slippers to replace my Go Walk 3's and they fit about the same.  Not sure where to go size-wise if I get a pair for summer as I know their regular shoes are too narrow for me.  I do love the cushioned insoles, though and the look of them."

I can buy my normal size in the wide width instead of a bigger size. They have a supportive foot bed that feels like Memory Foam, and the cloth upper stretches enough so that my terrible toes and bad bunions have room without the shoe looking bulky. Yes, you can see the lumps of my toes through the cloth since I'm not wearing thick socks, but it's worth it for the comfort. They are also nice and light. I'm going to buy more in different colors!"

A few years later, I started having symptoms again. Someone suggested Skechers so I tried the Go Walk 3. It was immediate relief! I discovered that they had better arch support which is apparently what I needed. When I needed new ones, I couldn't find the Go Walk 3 so I bought these. They are comfortable and fit really well.

I have a few small complaints; one, they are not water proof, more like “water resistant”, unfortunately, I’ve come out of my shift with wet feet a few times. Two, they definitely need some added arch support for the long days, they do have some support built in, but I after an 8+ hour shift, I could use a little more. And three, the material is fabric, even though it is strong fabric, it still can rip. My toe caught on the corner of the beer cooler and it made a tiny hole a few weeks ago, the upside is that the hole has not gotten any bigger than the ball point of a pen.

May 15th Ok its been since March that I have been wearing these shoes I have had nerve pain with my feet before wearing these shoes and also i'm over weight , I do think that the insole is not that comfortable but just replaced it with a Dr scrolls and it made the shoe perfect !  they have held up wonderful also the most comfortable shoe that I have ever worn to work , They fit like a glove , they remind me of a aqua shoe but more comfortable .very light weight which is Awesome ! Size up and you should have no problem."

I remove the inner soles and switch them out depending on how much walking I need to do. The best thing is no shoe laces. I have broken bones on the top of my feet to tying my shoes takes forever to find a comfortable fitting. This helps out a lot. Plan on buying another pair whenever this one wears out. This has non-skid soles and perfect for my job.

I love them so far. They're very comfortable. Others are right though, about it being tight on the top of the foot. Hopefully that loosens up with time. But they are still so much more comfortable than what I was wearing before. They are also the most slip resistant shoes I've worn. I'm not so sure that these would be great outdoor work shoes. I wouldn't want to step in a deep puddle or anything wearing these. I have a feeling you'd be left with wet feet. For indoor jobs, they're great. I hate to weigh in something different about the sizing comments because it seems like they're all over the place from these reviews. But I bought my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly."

Normally have to go up a size with sketchers. I bought my normal size and after wearing to work two days I have blisters these shoes are so bad fitting! Fit fine heel to toe. Width of shoe however was loose. Had to make sure they weren't a wide fit shoe. My foot keep slipping around in the shoe. I'm a server and work 8-9 hour shifts. Have bought only sketchers for work for almost 30 years. Have never had a problem like this with this brand. Disappointed! My last few pair of sketchers in different styles haven't held up as long as they used to. Now these don't fit at all. Almost enough I'm ready to try other brands! Can't afford to keep getting bad shoes when I'm on my feet as much as I am for work. What happened to quality control?

It fit nicely in all the proper ways and makes a great work shoe.  It had a nice slip resistant sole.  Easy on/off.  Good width.  My toesies had adequate space.  Nothing was rubbing against my heal or ankle.  In all respects awesome. Buuuut.... what all descriptions fail to mention (and I've found it in only 2 reviews) is that there's a little bump where the arch of the foot is supposed to be.  This would be fine if I had arches but I don't.  My feet are quite flat.  I wore these around the house for a few hours trying to make myself love them and ended up in pain.  If I wore these to work, I'd probably end up having to go home.  Not only that, the bump is really out of place, it's more towards the heal than at the arch. But, it takes all kinds."

I pull them on and they fit great. I can attest to the non-slip feature, as I work in a grocery store and have to mop the floor. So far, I've not slipped. The bad thing about these shoes is the insoles and, I guess, the soles. They are AWFUL--thin and completely unsupportive. I was in pain after an hour on my feet. I am 220 pounds, but still. I got some Dr. Scholl's work insoles, which made a world of difference. So, all in all, I'd recommend these shoes for their good qualities, but their drawbacks are pretty significant. I'll probably buy a different pair with better sole cushioning when I need to replace these."

The tongue of this shoe is held in place with wide strips of elastic, kinda like a typical slip-on shoe. It also has fake laces across the top that don't have any give whatsoever. Maybe over time those would loosen up a bit, or you could remove the fake laces and add real ones that are adjustable, but I'd rather just buy something that is comfy to begin with. These were too tight, uncomfortable, and suuuper not breathable. I wore them for maybe five minutes around my house and it was enough to make up my mind to return them."

While the size is correct, I'm now dealing with bruising across the top of my foot near the tongue of the shoe. It's just far too tight at the top. These are supposed to be ""relaxed fit"" shoes. I plan to take out the tight elastic lacing and put my own laces in, to help loosen the top. Overall, I like the shoes. Just wish they were a touch looser near the lacing."

Don't they bother to check anything before it is shipped like ensuring both shoes are the same size and not the same foot? In this case one shoe had a used Dr. Scholls insert in it - nasty. Total waste of time and money. If I wanted that I could have just gone to Goodwill.

They are so easy to put on and take off. I work in a vehicle repair shop as a service advisor and walk around on concrete all day. My feet never hurt after switching to these shoes. The slip resistant really works. I never worry about slipping when I have to walk through the shop. I have purchased 3 pairs in a row. I may have to buy serval pairs so I never run out.

The insert is thin and has no support whatsoever. My feet get sore relatively fast wearing them. Also when I worked in prep foods I nearly slipped everytime I wore these. That being said they are easy to slip on and off and the tops of the shoe are very soft. When I bought them they were 25 dollars. I definetly do not recommend spending anymore than that on them.

Pretty thin and feel like they will fall apart after everyday use within 6 months unlike other shoes I have.They seem to run down quickly and could be treated because water goes right through them in the rain.

I work on my feet on concrete floors averaging 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day. I have had 2 major surgeries on both of my feet. My toes on my left foot curl and I have a callus on my toes from the fact that they curl. I have always had to have standard black leather work anti- slip shoes, for 20 years. Well this year the company I work for got lax and said we can now have shoes with color! I found these shoes and man do they have color. Needless to say wearing new shoes for me has always been a challenge since they had to be black leather. The break-in process was very painful. My curled toe would bleed, hurt, and cramp. Then I’d have to put a bandage on my toe, which just added to the thickness of the shoe. It’s just miserable. I bought these shoes due to the fact that they were Skechers, anti-slip and COLORFUL!! They are the most comfortable shoe I have ever experienced in my life. I put them on and worked all day with not one bit of pain, cramping, or bleeding toes. Plus the comments I got on the color was fun."

Yes, I bought the right size.  Yes, they fit/were not too small.  However, after wearing them once, both of my ankles were cut into and bleeding in my socks.  I tried to put a pad against the back to keep it from getting worse, but boy did it not help.  These went back, because even two weeks after I wore them, my ankles are still scabbed and healing.  It's a bummer, because while the shoes aren't as cushioned/supportive as they claim to be, they did feel great to walk in, for the short while I tolerated my ankles getting destroyed."

I came across these after much research. After reading every review possible I decided that these would be a good fit. I wore them for the first time today. The fit was perfect although some reviews stated that they were too small. I wear a size 10 (ordered a size 10) and have a somewhat wider foot. The fit was fine. Pros are that my ankles feel much better than they did after working in my old shoes. The nonslip is amazing!! The floors in near the dishwasher are always wet and slippery. These shoes make it as if the water isn't even on the floor. I didn't slip once!! I have the blue and pink and they are super cute. Cons would be that they do need to be broken in so I'm hoping that once they are that my feet won't hurt as much. Just certain points in the shoes made my feet hurt so I think that is the issue."

I actually own two pairs of these shoes. I work in the medical field and am on my feet for long hours. After a long day, I would suffer the pain of plantar fasciitis and it was difficult to stand or walk. I tried a few different types of shoes that were highly recommended like the Dansko crocs. Those did not work for me but these Skechers are the best shoes I’ve found yet. The memory foam is amazing. At first I was skeptical because it does take a couple days to break into these shoes. After the first week, my feet were in shoe heaven. They feel really light and no more painful feet at the end of my shift. Aside from the memory foam, it’s non-slip and the material is so durable that liquid doesn’t easily penetrate. You literally have to soak your shoes in liquid to get the inside wet. Some people complain that the shoes are too rigid but I don’t mind because that helps maintain the durability of these shoes."

I have worn sketchers with memory foam before but thought I would try these as I am a nurse and have quite a bit of foot pain when I am on my feet all day. The memory foam was much more firm than I remembered with previous Sketchers. I knew there was a ""break-in"" period but have worn these for about a month and a half and they still feel kind of stiff. On my right foot, my pinky toe gets pinched at times and is painful when I wear them all day. The fit is as expected and I like the color but I think in the future I will go with the other memory foam that Sketchers sells. Foot pain is slightly better but not gone."

I bought these shoes because I needed durable yet comfortable shoes. I have always enjoyed my Sketchers shoes prior to this purchase. After wearing for about three weeks the toe reinforcement is starting to peel.  They are very heavy and not so comfortable.

I was looking for waterproof shoes to wear in the rain and while watering plants, things like that, and these are almost the only waterproof shoes out there that are affordable so I took the risk. I got a 9 M which is my true size and these shoes fit perfectly. They're incredibly comfortable, good looking (come with extra laces of different color), lightweight and truly waterproof. I've used them in rain, I've poured a little water on them just to test them and they can really be wiped clean. I will probably be buying only these shoes forever since they're great to wear come rain, come shine. Thanks for a great product. I wish they were more commonly available in stores too."

They really skimped with the memory foam support liner in these, which is whatever, I have to wear an orthotic insole with other pairs too but this is REALLY thin compared to other sneakers I’ve bought from the brand. The soles are perfect. I wore them in both recent ice storms we had in our area and didn’t even almost slip in them, however... they are made to be water resistant. Which, you’d think would be great but it’s awful. It makes the shoe have absolutely no give to it and there’s no way to “break them in.” I work at a hospital and am on my feet walking at a moderately fast pace for 10 hours a day... I was hoping these would be my new work shoes but I can barely tolerate a trip to the grocery store in them with how hard and uncomfortable they are on my feet. Very disappointed.

It has saved my shoes and socks from water and even urine. They're cute and so durable. I've had mine for a couple years and they're still in good shape. The only con I have is that they run a little small. They were a little small when I first purchased them. I've since lost weight and gone down in my shoe size so now they're perfect. I'd suggest ordering a half to full size larger with these shoes. When I need to I will repurchase these again.

It was too large even when I placed my own inserts inside. To remedy this, I cut out the laces and replaced them with regular ones. NOT SLIP-RESISTANT. The only reason for buying the shoe and it fails so spectacularly in its purpose. These don't even prevent falls with water. I had hoped roughing them up a bit for a few weeks might help.

We bought them on Amazon because the price was better.  She likes the look and the comfort.  However these fit a little loose.  There was no way to tighten them up because the laces are elastic and you can't tighten them.  I bought her some inserts for the shoes and that seemed to help.  Also the insert that is in the shoe is glued in and you can't remove it.  If you use specific inserts (like I do) you may not want these, for us it wasn't a problem.  All in All we recommend the shoe."

But I’m icing my knees, these are NOT slip resistant. If they made shoes that made it easier to slip on surfaces purposely these are them! I have worn my regular shoes and mopped floors at work and managed to stay on my feet. The first day I had these I slipped moping and slipped in the drink station. I am a server. Guest seen my fall and it was messed up to find out I wasted my time waiting for shipping ect. These must be some fake china shoes with fake labels for money. This is NOT OKAY! I’ve worn them for like 2 months now.. I got it ready to send back but they were cute and comfortable so I started wearing them anyways... well today I was running for some spoons for a guests dinner soup and I have never slapped the floor so hair, first it was my knees then my arms and it hurt to even get up and now I can barely walk with out a limp. I’m in so much pain. I mop floors every night and it takes extra effort to keep myself afloat."
Skechers,for Work Women's Squad SR Food Service Shoe,B073WHMZPH,R300NKATH3LDGN,"September 27, 2018",2,Just Meh,"I needed nonslip shoes for work and was looking for sneakers that didn’t 100% look like typical non slip shoes (big/ high sole and all over leather). These looked decent and I’ve heard good things about sketchers. In most other sneakers I wear a 9-9.5 so I went with the larger size just in case. Turns out they were a little too big for me. Before exchanging them I happened to see the exact pair at a local shoe store and tried on the smaller size. Glad I did! Even though the small size for better they were not comfortable. I can feel the outside lining (where the edge is pressed/glued down) of the memory foam padding which is not very comfortable. And you cannot tighten the laces. I find this to be a super annoying trend, but maybe that’s just me.  Aside from that I can not see wearing them for long periods of time. Memory foam doesn’t give long lasting support during the day, and tend to cause foot pain anyway. So either way the shoes got returned and I went with a different pair."
Skechers,for Work Women's Squad SR Food Service Shoe,B073WHMZPH,R2HIPV2OU3N9SF,"December 14, 2019",4,My thoughts on these Skechers work sneakers,"I got the shoes to be able to wear them at work without breaking the unspoken business casual dress code. I also wanted shoes that were comfortable for me to walk in, but I have plantar faciitis so that is really difficult for me to do without breaking the bank! I saw these shoes online and thought I should try them out because my last pair of Skechers (Air Walk) were pretty light and, not as supportive as I would like, are light enough that I don't struggle with them. Wanted to give these shoes a chance because they seemed sturdier and made for standing and walking, which seems good for me. First off, the shoes fit nicely! The shoes state they have a roomier fit than a standard shoe and they weren't kidding. I was worried because in person the shoes look pretty small compared to some wider shoes I own. It feels nice to have that wiggle room. They also don't have shoe laces to tie, which is probably a plus to most people. Would like to have some means of adjusting how tight it was, but if you get your proper shoe size it should be okay. They are also pretty sturdy and I hope they last me longer than my other shoes. However, while the roomier fit doesn't make my feet feel constricted, I would have liked to have the shoes a bit tighter around the ankles. Also would have liked for a bit more support. Skechers uses memory foam for almost every shoe that they sell and I never liked it. I still don't like it much because I can never have enough support with the memory foam that they use in general. That is just on my feet though. Every foot is different and the memory foam could be perfect for your feet. Normally you can't fit an insole well in a shoe whose insole doesn't come off, but the roomier fit might help with that so I might try and see if I can fit one in my shoe. It's not meant to be used like this though and I'm only doing this because I need a bit more than what the memory foam can give me. As for the rest of the stuff (i.e. anti slip and insulation against electrical stuff) the anti slip bottoms work extremely well. Works well under wet conditions and better than the average on icy conditions. Keep in mind that these are designed for mainly wet floors or a slippery surface that you may encounter. In terms of outdoor snowy or icy conditions, while you may have less of a chance of slipping please still proceed with caution as you can still slip if you are not careful. I cannot speak on the electical insulation because I have not tried to test that myself. My line of work doesn't have me ever dealing on a situation where I would ever accidentally step on something that can shock me. Overall, these shoes are pretty comfortable with regards to how easy they sre to slip on and how much room you have for your feet, and do what they advertised. However the arch support is really up to preference. If you have used memory foam insole shoes like Skechers before and you had no issues in the past with them then you will like the support these have. If you are like me and the memory foam just isn't enough for you you might want a shoe that either has a removable insole so you can add your own, or you might want something that is designed with more support."

I bought a pair of off brand non slips about a year ago and they worked a million times better but weren’t very comfortable. That is why I decided to try these. First night at work I am walking quickly through the kitchen and I slipped and fell. FIRST NIGHT WEARING THEM. The floor isn’t that slippery in the kitchen but happened to be just the right amount of moisture for me to fall. I was lucky I didn’t hit my head. Do not buy these if you work in a fast paced, high volume restaurant, you will get hurt. Save your money and buy a different brand. Very sad because they were sooo comfortable."

I bought them online, just reading the description, if I had handled  them in real  life I would not have bought them, because they feel flimsy, of poor quality, not made of sturdy materials. The shoe has stretched out since I have been wearing them. They came with elastic bindings where the shoe laces go, and I removed those and put in my own laces. But you cannot tighten the laces enough to make the shoe fit your foot. I also added an insole with some arch support. It is a light weight shoe, and the bottom sole bends very easily. But I am disappointed in the shoe. It does not feel like it will last her long because it feels made of poor quality materials. I have had them for about six weeks, and I do not know if they will last through the winter."

I put my foot in the shoes and I felt comfort right away which means they will be good for an 8 hour shift testing them out on Monday so hopefully I'm right. They run a little big which is fine because I will be wearing socks with them and my feet tend to swell during the day so to me that's a bonus. I wear Skechers for my regular sneakers and love them so I'm glad they make slip resistant shoes for work as well.

The only negative I can say is that I can't wear my heel support if my plantar fasciitis acts up because I didn't purchase the wider width.

This gowalk 5 has a better design it appears and should allow me to just stamp my feet when I come in from walks and not have to pick out gravel. Yippee. I am now thinking I should grab a second pair while this is still available as I could not find this in stores, such as Macy's, as they have gone up the ladder to newer and uglier models. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, eh? The shoes generally serve me for over a year. Going forward that far this shoe may not be available. I have not walked outside with the shoes yet, but I anticipate good results. UPDATE after walking outside - My left ankle hurts after walking a few miles outside today. Thank goodness I did not order a second pair as a backup. The cushioning on this later model is not as good as the go walk 4 of which I have had two pair. Disappointed!"

Skechers,Women's Go Walk 5-15901 Sneaker,B07N13K5S7,RQ221L3XTLTMI,"February 5, 2020",5,The most comfortable shoe I’ve ever worn.,"I had to attend a week-long work convention and knew I needed comfortable yet work-appropriate stylish shoes. I went to the Skechers store on my lunch break and this was the first shoe I tried on. I walked all around the store trying on other shoes while keeping one of these on my foot. This was the hands-down winner. As soon as I got to the car with my purchase I slipped these back on and I’ve not worn another pair of shoes to work since! I was the only coworker who was not miserably sore at the end of each day at the conference, walking 20-25,000 steps each day. No foot pain, no joint pain in knees or hips, either. After wearing these for two days pre-conference I ordered this pair from Amazon for my mom. She’s had two foot surgeries and has a back injury, and she loves these shoes. She’s had none of the pain and discomfort that she experiences with other doctor-recommended shoes which cost double the price of this pair.  She wants me to order additional colors for her, and I’m planning to do the same for myself, along with a back-up black pair. Pros: Easy to slip on and off. Back of shoe does not collapse at all when sliding on shoe, yet not so sturdy and unforgiving to cause blisters when walking. The memory foam and the cushioned sole makes it feel like you’re walking on clouds. Cons: Feels very slightly over-sized when wearing this shoe with a thin no-show sock or without socks."

Two of us went on our lunch break.  The foam was such a pleasant surprise!  Now, my feet were still hurting for a few days while wearing these (I was still recovering from the pain-it doesn't disappear that quickly) but it was a different hurt - it was a worked/tired sort of hurting from moving fast for hours at a time on concrete.  Now, it has been a week and I've worn these for a total of 4 straight 9 hour days at work and I love them!  I want more - I'm waiting on them to offer them in a hunter green or a shade of green as it would match my work outfit.  I bought the navy blue/hot pink ones in the size the shoe store said I wore.  What is interesting is they said these were not offered in wide or B's or E's, etc. but on here they show that they are offered in B's and E's, and I would order the B since I have wide feet and high arches. My tip: is I wear performance socks with these - the type they advise people with diabetes to wear.  I do not have diabetes but my feet/ankles will swell and hold fluid due to poor circulation (just hereditary) after being on concrete all day, so the performance socks squeeze my legs and help with circulation and make these super easy to slip on and off. I really appreciate the foam feel of these - very soft/squishy - really like these and I'm so glad I listened to another co-worker and tried these.  They are worth it to me because I have noticed a huge difference in my performance at work now that I'm not limping and trying to get through the last couple hours of work.  My feet are still sore but that is from a long day of hard work. These are worth it and I want more in a variety of colors. I bought these at a local shoe store  I am attaching a photo showing the shoe on one foot with the performance sock on and the other shoe beside it to shoe the inside of shoe"

For reference, my feet measure 8 WW, though I often buy 8.5 W (ie, Munro) because I like the extra room in the toe area, or a size 9 M if wide widths are not available. I also have a high arch/instep. For Skechers GW line, I had been buying size 9. With GW 2's (Hypo, Super Sock and Super Breathe), the fit was amazing---the shoes are so light and cushy, I didn't feel like I was wearing  shoes. No tightness (length/width/top of the foot) and no slippage, either...absolutely perfect! I ordered the same size 9 for GW 3 and the fit is different like another review stated. Because of my high instep, I feel tightness across the top of both feet, my right in particular. This is the first time I sense a break-in period for me with this line.  I'm keeping them, but will probably shop for more 2's in the future. I will update if these break-in to the level of comfort in fit that I've found in GW 2's right out of the box. If you do not have a high instep, I HIGHLY recommend these shoes because the cushion factor has definitely been kicked up another notch in the GW 3 (which is why I gave a 4 instead of a 3). UPDATE: There was a very unexpected, but brief break-in period for me. The overall length seems just a bit shorter than GW2 and the fit across the top of my foot is firm, but it's no longer painful. The cushioned support is UNBELIEVABLE---raising my rating to a 5. I literally had no pain or fatigue at all in my feet after teaching all day---I have heel spurs, weak ankles and wrestle with PF on and off----this is another GREAT shoe from the GW line! July 2015 UPDATE#2: This is kind of embarrassing, but hopefully worth knowing if you go sock-less in your GW's like I do. This particular GW3 model which I have in both beige and black gets stinky. Both colors get stinky.  I have a huge collection (GW2 Hypo being my favorite and most worn) so I don't wear them day after day---they're rotated----regularly------with air-dry time (not boxed up)-----and well, they stink.  Not across-the-room stink, but they have an odor that my other GW2's that are older have not developed. Going back to 4 stars because I still like them for their insanely comfortable ""cushion factor."" May try them with sock liners."

I had tried another model of a Sketchers slip-on Go Walk shoe in a store and that model ran small, so I ordered a half size bigger than my normal size when ordering large. Ordering this half size larger made it the right size for length, but the width and/or height made the shoe feel like an extremely tight band around my foot. I had them on for literally about 1 minute and couldn't stand it. Had to send these back and was so disappointed."

They each lasted for over a year, but these are nowhere near as durable. I purchased these on 6/7/2016 and I have just noticed today, 9/16/2016 that I have walked through the bottom of the right shoe. I am really displeased that a three month old shoe already has to go in the garbage. They may be comfortable, but don't expect them to last! I doubt I will buy a pair of GoWalks again."

They are light and have great ventilation. I have lots on knee and ankle problems and the weight and support of these shoes has already offered up some relief. Great quality and style. I thought they would look funky but I adore them. Will definitely be adding another pair in a different color soon!

Pros, read they are good for plantar fasciitis, and they did have a nice spring in the step, but since they would not stay on my foot even with a thicker sock, they went back immediately. I thought I had an average foot. I wear a lot of Hi-Tech Hiking shoes/boots so if you are concerned, and fit Hi-Tech well too, then I hope that tidbit of info helps The only socks that work are the liners, as even no-show socks show! Update, tried a Gowalk Joy with lace up. Although this fit my heel better, it was a bit snug all round, and my feet were leaning to the outside... odd... didn't keep those as that made my feet HURT just after a short time in the house. Tried on the Delights at an outlet store. They didn't fit - my size too short, half size up too loose in the heel again. Guess skechers are not for me. That being said, I was disgusted after reading some reviews... some people received dirty, used shoes. How does that sound acceptable amazon? In a diff shoe I was looking at, One nurse even said she wore her purchase for several long shifts before deciding they weren't for her and was glad for the 30 day free returns... Come on people, quit taking advantage or this policy will soon be gone! Some of us use it for fit, not to use and abuse and then return."

The toe box is a little flat so ...,"I ordered these in my regular shoe size, and they fit fine. The toe box is a little flat so I couldn't wear these all day; they would rub the top of my toes. There are two things I absolutely loathe about these shoes. One-the knob like sole feels like you're walking on marshmallows. This has gotten a little better over the last couple of weeks but the shoes don't give a good sense of support. Two-when the soles of these shoes get even slightly wet, they start squeaking!  The wetter they get, they louder they squeak!  It's very hard to try to keep them dry with sprinklers running year round here in S. CA. I find myself trying to dodge any wet spots on the sidewalks, and that's really rather ridiculous. I just placed an order for Easy Spirits instead. I had my previous pair of Easy Spirits for close to two years without any problems. And that's with a lot of walking. My husband had tried the Skechers as well and reported the same issues. I just didn't realize I had ordered the same lousy shoes until I had already worn them a few times so too late to return."

They are like walking on little clouds. Can't wait to go on a long walk in these. Also I wear a size 10 and got a 9.5 they run a little big.
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 3 Slip-On Walking Shoe,B07MKPM6B6,R2UYGUXZY2MT3G,"February 1, 2018",4,I don't love the Go Walk 3. Narrow but soles but are supportive and comfortable. Will definitely go to a shoe store next time!,"I've just gotten these and may want to revise or add to this review later.  So far the fit is very snug, more narrow than a medium 8 but a true 8 in length. They are a bit smaller than the Go Walk 4 Kindles, size 8.  Due to their smaller size I had trouble pulling them on although I still have at least a half inch to 3/4 inch wiggle room for my toes. There was an area in the right shoe that rubbed my heel painfully but the material is such that I was able to step sideways on it for awhile and softened the area up some so it's not bad anymore.  The insoles are very nicely padded with good support.  I have bunions on both feet and the mesh material is very comfortable and conforming so I have no pain.  That's a big deal for me!  There are areas on the shoe that rub which I think may be due to the narrowness of this style but they should be fine with breaking in even though I've read other reviewers state that there is no break in period required for Sketchers.  And the tops are snug on my feet but have no tags inside to chaf. The bottom soles are a none skid.  I've yet to walk with them in snow or that type of slippery surface, however the soles seem like they will be very good in bad weather. I can't say that I love them YET but may have a more positive feeling about them once I've walked in them awhile.  These insoles are not as comfortable as the Go Walk 4 Kindle and may not be as comfortable as the other Sketchers of this type but I'll keep them.  I'm not totally thrilled with them so I'll go to a shoe store next time to try them on."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 3 Slip-On Walking Shoe,B07MKPM6B6,R35OFCHKPO7S6C,"June 15, 2016",5,My new FAVORITE shoe,"I made the mistake of trying a pair of New Balance shoes after my last pair of Skechers retired; Skechers, I promise I'll never do it again. New Balance is supposed to be ""higher end"" and those shoes didn't last 6 months of minimal use (less an hour a week) which was 1/6 of the lifetime of my shape ups, yes my last pair lasted THREE YEARS and the NB lasted less than six months... So this pair of shoes arrived today. My size was the same after over 3 1/2 years of having purchased my last Skechers shoe. I put them on and my feet felt like they were on a cloud. I wanted to go for a walk just because these shoes are just that comfortable, I'm not an outdoors or athletic type person. I'd rather be watching TV, listening to music, or reading a book, so that may give you an idea of how much I love these shoes. I did wear them out in the backyard as I pulled some weeds, I did not wear them with socks. I think I'll end up needing to pick up some of those minimal socks just because I'm so used to having them on. OH! So another thing that may tell you about the comfort of these shoes. I have a SEVERE blister on my left pinkie toe, it cause my toe to swell to almost 2x its normal size. Wearing socks right now hurt but me putting on this shoe caused NO pain at all. Honestly I want another pair to use as house shoes, and a backup pair. I don't need them, but I want them!"

I wear size 11 in everything and they always fit; this was a snug size 11 and I ended up with a small watter blister on the side of my big toe, knuckle joint in a few minutes but within an hour they fit fine just took some walking around in them.  To me it looks great, I thought it was attractive in the picture and I was just as happy with it in person.  Just got back from an hour walk and ugh they are causing pain, in the right shoe only (that foot is bigger) where the side material meets the bottom of the shoe so it's like I'm walking on a seam.  Also the collar of the shoe is tight especially on my left foot which is smaller than my right foot.  My feet are not particularly wide so this is a warning to those who order this shoe wear it a lot indoors if you aren't quite sure about the fit before you go outside and can't return it like me.  I finally had to return these.  It wasn't worth the blister that formed on the top of my left foot where the collar of the shoe is too tight."

A friend at work recommended these shoes and when they arrived I put them on and if I didn't have to take them off for sleep or bathing, I swear they'd stay on forever.  Finally a shoe that makes walking on the hard floors at work and concrete sidewalks downtown feel like walking on air!  My feet stopped hurting and that made my legs stop hurting!  Love them!!!!!!"
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 3 Slip-On Walking Shoe,B07MKPM6B6,R2BZH9PN6MCWPX,"November 20, 2017",3,Tiny bit snug across top,"This is the 6th pair of go walks ive ordered in the past 2 or 3 yrs. In general they usually run true to size and are comfy from day one and last me at least a yr or more. I received these within a couple days of ordering and tho other reviews suggest the upper material is stretchy, its not at all. They run a little tight across the top but not horrifying enough to go through the exchange process. Ill keep them and wear shorter periods of time to hopefully loosen them up before attempting to stand in them for any serious length of time. Super cute and comfy other than being a little too snug across top. Id probably order them a half size up if i needed them to walk any kind of distance right away. Oh, and theres something different in the heel, a tiny bit of extra padding to keep from slipping and causing blisters. Never seen that before and wish more shoes had it!!!"
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 3 Slip-On Walking Shoe,B07MKPM6B6,RX8U11S06A6B4,"July 22, 2017",1,Horrible,I have had several pair of Skechers before and loved each pair...these are awful.  They are tight and have no give at all.  My other Skechers gave my legs and feet energy & comfort.  This particular style Skechers gave my legs and feet pain & discomfort.
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 3 Slip-On Walking Shoe,B07MKPM6B6,R195BVIVCMD5V0,"June 28, 2018",3,Not the Skechers they used to be,"Loved my first three pair of Skechers.  Perfect shoes.  Fit like a glove, no need to ""break"" in, flexible yet excellent support and balance, could be worn all day, and were stylish enough that I lived in them for all occasions.  I only wish I'd bought 20 pair when I had the chance and stockpiled them for future use.  Over the years, Skechers has made several changes and NOT for the better.  This latest purchase is still stylish looking, but feels like wearing a wicker basket.  The upper has a plastic-like, scratchy texture that doesn't breathe well and is so stiff it binds in several areas across my feet.  The inner lining (which used to be smooth and allowed the foot to move easily) is abrasive and causes the soles of my feet to burn with prolonged wearing.  Not to mention it makes it harder to get the shoes on.  The cushioning feels cheaper and no longer provides good arch support, so I don't feel the same balance and stability I used to rely on. And after wearing daily for ten days, I find myself kicking these shoes off at every opportunity to give my feet a break. I've given this purchase 3 ""it's okay"" stars, but for Skechers that's like condemning them with faint praise.  Compared to the earlier styles, I actually hate them."

I got these in 8.5, and could barely get into ONE shoe.  It was tight, and the rolled top edge was stiff.  Once it was on I had immediate pain from the pressure of the stiff of the rolled edge above my big toe - c'mon, Skechers are supposed to be comfortable, soft and stretchy - they are not called ""Stiffers!"" This isn't my first encounter with a stiff rolled edge in Skechers:  I've tried Knot Concerned in several sizes in several stores, and they all had that irritating stiff edge.  Sad, because I'd really like to have these Go Walk 3 shoes AND the Knot Concerned! Other than that, the color was great - exactly the super-bright turquoise I love but have rarely found in shoes, the padding inside seemed like typical good Skechers padding and there was more around the heel, but sadly, I couldn't even put my foot down on the floor and keep the one shoe on for longer than maybe 30 seconds, that stiff rolled edge was poking me so much!

I went looking for another pair to replace them. I have large feet (size 11) and even the Skechers' web site did not have my size, even in colors I wasn't looking for. I thought I'd check on Amazon, not really expecting to find a pair, and what a wonderful surprise: they had my size, my color and they arrived Jiminy-quick in a couple days. I've been wearing them ever since, am wearing them now, even. Here's what I like: they cuddle my feet. I could be walking on clouds, or so it feels. They are well-made; the stitching is as sturdy as it is pretty. The bottoms retain their shape and support through long days of being worn. My feet love these shoes, my favorite by far!"

This is a very good quality product and it will be blessing for those who are suffering due to poor quality shoes. It is may be $20 to $25 expensive compare to some available at cheaper stores but these extra $25 will make your life much better. Even if you don't need non-slip shoes these will be good for your feet over all. Their non-slip quality is also good, just don't forget to remove a sticker under the shoe. Update: After 8 months feet are hurting again using these shoes. I guess they lose the comfort after so many months."

My feet hurt so bad after my shifts that I could almost cry. I decided to spent the extra money and get these shoes and I'm so glad I did. I have had them 1 year and I have finally wore them out. I work 4-5 days a week and average 20-35 hours a week so these shoes have been wore a lot! They finally started to get holes in the toe seam and the tread is detaching. I have abused these shoes, they are wore on concrete flooring and always walking through nasty stuff in the restaurant kitchen  (I've never slipped once). They fit like a glove and are sooo comfy. I love that they slip on and off easily and look good with pants, capris or shorts. I highly recommend these."

They have a memory foam insole and they slip right on, I have worn them for work a few nights already and on one of those nights we had to do some extra cleaning tasks which involved hosing down the floor and even though there was all that water my shoes never got wet. my feet stayed dry and that was one of the biggest problems I faced with my old work shoes. They would absorb all the water, mess up my feet for days, stay damp for days, fall apart faster due to water damage and smelled awful. the worst part was my old shoes cost almost twice what these cost me so I would recommend these for anyone who needs water resistant shoes"

I don't like a heavy shoe or one that makes my feet sweat and these shoes fit those needs. They have a breathable upper and are lightweight to wear. I tend to wear thin socks so the shoes fit slightly loose on my feet but not so loose that they are a problem. If a person wore a heavier sock I am sure they would fit snugger.

They’re name brands and they let us choose from many styles but are the most uncomfortable things ever. I went home every time I worked in excruciating pain.  I’m not horribly out of shape so it always pissed me off. I’m not the thinnest person but I’m active. Anyway, I was wearing my sketchers and bringing my Disney shoes in case they called me out on it. The sketchers go walks were so amazingly comfortable and I never went home with any foot pain. So o decide to buy these, thinking they’d be like the Go Walks but non slip and acceptable for work. I wore them for the first time today and although not as horrid as some others I’ve worn, still hard and at the end of the day it hobble into my home in pain. So now I’m truly thinking the nonslip soles are the culprit. I want my sketchers Go Walks comfort! So I’m not as pleased as I thought I’d be. I thought I’d found a pair of shoes that would not make me feel 80 at the end of a shift. The arch support is nice and the shoe feels well molded to my foot, but it’s hard as a rock on the insoles. I may try some insoles to alleviate pain. But it upsets me bc I spent $50 on these hoping I found a good comfortable show that meets Disney requirements."

I've worn Sketchers before and I was happy with them, so I took a chance on buying these online. When I first walked on them, I felt a twinge in my left foot, which usually means my feet will start hurting quickly. So I took my old shoes to work with me just in case, but I never had a problem. They come up kind of high on my right foot, which started to rub a little, but I tried to be conscious of correcting how I walk, as I tend to roll my right foot out a little. So far (after a week) they haven't given me any pain, though I haven't tested them on a double shift, as of yet. I also fell a few weeks ago in our kitchen at work, wearing some very expensive, non-slip Alegrias. I decided not to spend as much money, though the Alegrias were hella comfortable and were the first shoes I'd worn in years that didn't give me horrible foot, leg and hip pain during and after my shifts. I'm cautiously optimistic! They're springy and light, especially compared to the Alegrias. My other job has a dish pit that isn't even and we have to wade through nasty water at the end of the night, so I'm concerned about that because these are fabric, but we'll see how they hold up. I also don't know if I can throw these in the washer, which would be nice. Anyway, so far, so good!

Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 4 - Pursuit Walking Shoe,B01AH0BMJK,R2W0CPIFZ56J41,"August 28, 2016",5,LOVE these - especially for the price.,"I bought this shoe with the intention of wearing it as a work shoe for the office. I have ""normal"" feet (no major issues that is) and am normal for width and arch. I have a bad back, and I need good supportive shoes as I am on the feet and running a lot of the time (I'm in healthcare). I have had Skechers before, but these ones take the cake. Pros: Light - I truly can't believe how light this shoe is. It's like having a sock on its so light Comfortable - right out of the box - there is no breaking in. Again - like wearing a sock. Good grip - so far I have not seen any slippage with this shoe as far as traction on the terrain. Flex - it flexes extremely well and allows for natural movement of the foot while staying put so there is no hitting your toes on the front of the shoe (which I've had problems with in the past). Support - they really surprised me with the amount of support. I wear them around home now all the time because they keep my hips and lower back from aching. Cons: Style - personally I don't think they are cute. But I bought some cute ones with my last purchase and I hated them. I'd rather have comfort at my job than super cute if they leave me horrible achy at the end of the day. Stuffy - the shoe doesn't breathe as well as a tennis shoe, but it's pretty darn close. My feet do tend to get a little hotter in these than my tennis shoes."

I chose it for the great price plus the overall look. I received them yesterday and immediately put them on. I wore them out running errands and extensive walking on different terrains throughout the day. These shoes were comfortable right out of the box. And they remained comfortable all day. In fact they are so light I forgot I had them on! No blisters. No rubbing. No breaking in period at all. And they are cute! Great shoe.  I'm giving them 5 stars!

My regular size 10 is now a little too short and narrow.  Size 11 is a little big, but with an insert and thicker socks, it's okay.  So when I found this model in size 10 1/2, thought I'd give it a try.  Perfect fit and I hope they make more of their shoes in 10 1/2. I uploaded a photo so you could see the design change.  On the left are the GoWalk2s (they look like they're leaning because I have a pronation problem...) and you can see that the toe area is rounder and the overall look is bulkier than the GoWalk4 on the right."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 4 - Pursuit Walking Shoe,B01AH0BMJK,R2UZ7TJYW1QIQZ,"November 23, 2017",5,Very Well Put Together Sneakers  - Perfect!,"I will update again after wearing these for at least a month. I have been waiting years to be able to have a pair of Skechers, but they didn’t make any of their shoes in wide widths. My whole family has wide feet for some reason. (It’s actually more common than people would think). Recently I was window shopping on Amazon, I did a search since my dad wanted a pair as well for his 80th birthday. He wears a Double-Wide, and I found a gorgeous pair of Skechers for him and he is as thrilled with his as I am with mine.So,  Low and behold they have Standard to Triple Wide widths now!  (The sizing system for shoes on Amazon is strange. I purchased these in a Standard Wide, or a C-D. I got lucky, because many of their shoes are a standard size, or what they show as (D)M. For my dad, I ordered a Double-Wide, or 2E. Both are perfect). These are very well made sneakers. First: looks. I purchased the charcoal/white in a size 8-Wide. The white part of the shoe is the outer sole. I believe there is a black on black sole available. It’s a gorgeous, sleek, well thought out shoe. The upper is cloth: not flimsy at all, but not at all stiff. Smooth material over the top of the foot, and a very pleasant, subtle pattern around the shoe. It is reinforced at the front, front-sides, and the heal. The wihite outer sole has a charcoal stripe (see photos) above a honeycomb pattern. It all fits perfectly together, and I haven’t gotten to the inside. There’s a Skechers “S” on the front and side of both shoes. Inside: The insoles are NOT removable. If you don’t wear socks, and wear these a lot, I would recommend getting a pack of those “cut to size” inner soles from the drugstore. I use them so I don’t get sweaty in there and to keep the insole clean. There is a fun, colorful pattern on the insoles that I believe is unique to Skechers. Fit: PERFECT!  Better than I’d expected!  These fit perfectly. They have just enough wiggle room without the heal slipping off. And ankle socks could be worn, but not thick socks. These shoes feel as if I’m walking on a cloud and getting a foot massage at the same time. The shoes are uber comfortable while feeling very solid. I have serious back issues, and these are absolutely fantastic sneakers hands down. I will update in a month or so regarding how they are holding up. These shoes can be dressed up or down, but not with a ball gown! They ARE sneakers; they are easy to put on; and  look and feel very well made. My father and I couldn’t be more thrilled with our Skechers, except when I buy my next pair. I already have them picked out."

My god. First of all, where have you been all my life? Secondly, can you please design them so that they're less granny looking? I currently match my mom and more grandmothers than I'd care to match but these were about the best I could do... Design aside, I love these shoes. Every single time I slip them on, I sigh happiness. They hug my feet as if to say, ""I love you."" Like, that's how good they feel. Just make sure to wear socks (no-show work well to decrease the old-lady factor) because these do not absorb sweat at all."

I buy them when I see a really great sale. Skechers are the only shoes I wear and they are so comfortable.  I personally feel as though they give plenty of support across the top of my foot where I need it after I had a lis franc fracture.  I like the fact that you can wash the shoes.  I usually wait to have five pair ready to wash and they go in with the towels or blue jeans.  I never put them in the dryer, but just let them air dry.  Since I have duplicate pairs, on the sole of the shoe, I put matching signs in m permanent markers so the shoes stay together and wear down at the same rate.  Be sure to look for them on sale and with a Prime membership, it makes it great.. As for the difference in Go Walk 3 and Go Walk 4, it all has to do with the cushions on the sole.  The Go Walk 3 has smaller cushion dots, while the Go Walk 4 has big ones.  I have had both and see no difference.  I was told the company is phasing out the 3's."

I also have a very high in step that makes it difficult find a pair of shoes on that fits comfortably.  I found a pair of the Sketcher Performance Women's Go Walk 4 Pursuit shoes (8 wide)in a local store when I was looking for a comfy pair of slip on shoes.  I tried them on and was really happy with the fit  and the memory foam soles are like walking on clouds. They were a bit pricey in the store so I pulled out my IPhone and scanned the UPC using Amazon's handy App.  I found them on Amazon $22 cheaper than anywhere else I looked and as a Prime member they shipped for free in just 2 days!  These shoes look really cute with Capri length workout pants or rolled jeans and a tshirt for running errands.  I recommend always wearing socks or your feet will sweat.  The shoes are super light weight and offer great support but could be a bit more breathable. That one little inconvenience  does not take away from the five stars as far as I'm concerned."

I’m overweight and started exercising about a year ago thanks to these shoes. It was difficult for me to bend over to put on socks and tie traditional athletic shoes so I got these. They work perfect...you can wear them without socks, they don’t rub or blister your feet, and they provide awesome support.  I just ordered my second pair and although I can now bend over to put socks on and tie traditional shoes I’m sticking with these. If you’re just getting into exercising and you’re overweight and you can’t find the right shoes so you’re putting off exercising because of that reason, please try the shoes it will get you on the right path.

They were comfortable initially and may be good run around shoes at home, but I would NOT recommend them for travel. They didn’t offer enough support or shock absorption and after a day of walking on brick and cobblestone sidewalks I was almost crippled! My lower back was killing me, my ankles were swollen and my feet hurt everywhere. I was actually limping. The toe box doesn’t allow for movement in the toes and they were crunched up in there- and I have a fairly narrow foot. I rubbed arnica gel all over my aches and pains so that I could get up and go again the next day. The next day I wore different shoes with inserts and felt great all day.  I didn’t wear these sketchers again the whole trip and I didn’t have any further issues with aching back, swollen ankles or crippled feet! The girls that recommended these on the travel blogs I looked at were young 20 somethings who don’t really need much support I guess, but I’m 52 and I do need it- so these shoes sucked for me.

I have been looking for an alternative work shoe as I am on my feet for long periods of time. Most of the women I work with have a pair of these shoes, so I decided to purchase a pair. The shoes arrived as stated. As soon as I tried them on, I could feel that they could be comfortable. My only concern is they are size 11 and are quite smug on my feet - especially the left one. Though my right foot is size 10, my left foot is probably 10.25 in size which is why I buy 11s when 10.5 is not available. So for these to fit like a size 10 is very disappointing. Ironically, the right shoe feels TERRIFIC! I am debating if I will send them back. Mentally, I cannot and will not exchange them for a 12."

But that's just me.,"Love this shoe.  It is actually helping to keep my  plantar fasciitis at bey.  This is my second time purchasing this brand, but first time on Amazon.  I give it 4.5 stars because for some reason, the 9.0 size (same size as my beat up ones) was a little tighter around the instep than my previous purchased shoes, so I ordered two of the 9.5 size.  Same result for that one too...one of the pair is sort of tight around the instep.  The other pair was strangely a bit better.  Go figure! I'm keeping this one, and exchanging the 2nd tighter 9.5 for either a 10B (regular width), or 9.5 C/D (wide).  Keeping my fingers crossed.  As far as I'm concerned, this shoe beats Nike which is what I used to wear all the time.  Sorry Nike!  Hello Skechers!"

If they'd been house slippers they would have been too wide and sloppy; as walking shoes it was out of the question.  Tried them on wearing thick exercise socks so that wasn't the problem.  I'm a solid B width with never a problem of medium being too wide.  I could not find the width marking on the shoe so will forever wonder if Amazon mistakenly sent a Wide instead of a medium.  The length was good, the soul felt springy, but they were so loose that I think an ankle injury from sliding off the sole would not have been impossible.  First pair of shoes I've ordered online.  Amazon will take them back but feeling a little gun shy about trying again."

My first Skechers Go Walk purchase was in 2014 and they were amazing. I even added them to my Christmas wish list because they were so comfortable and supportive that I wore them everyday. This year, 2018, Costco featured this new version, but Costco is an hour away so I ordered them on Amazon. I bought them in April and here it is August and as you can see one of the support circles, which is directly beneath the ball of my foot, has come out completely. I've considered using shoe goo to reattach it but honestly they aren't nearly as comfortable as the original version. After wearing the Go Walk 4 version, then slipping the original Go Walk's on I realized a tremendous difference in support. The original has a great arch support and more heel support. If I'd bought them from Costco, I could still return them. Lesson learned. Off to find some new magic shoes!"

Although they seem to have a little more bounce to the bottoms than the Empress, they still offer no real support in the arches or the balls of your feet. When I tried them on, they were comfortable to stand in (kind of like bedroom slippers), but walking across the room it was quite apparent they would not be so great in the long haul. Also, they look a bit geriatric. Had they been supportive, I would have probably kept them despite feeling they are kind of ugly. But comfort is paramount. Sent them back and am giving up on Sketchers, unfortunately."

These beautiful and super cute tennies came with the triple layered inner soles that make it so soft and comfy it feels like I'm walking on cotton.  Also, they don't heat up my feet at all, which is another big plus.  Add their fashion statement, and they are just the best!  I am on my feet all day long and have even had plantar fasciatis in the past, and these will clearly prevent that from recurring.  Soft, cool looking as they are cool to the feet, roomy toe area, easy kick-off/on, and that's the reason I will love my job that much more thanks to these great shoes.

So I needed a pair of shoes that were easy and quick to get on and would protect my toes. These shoes fit the bill. They are comfortable and fit fine but they are not attractive at all. I think I’d they didn’t have the faux laces they’d be better looking, but since I don’t plan to wear these except when walking or tending to the dog, they are good enough."

These are my favorites for all around general purpose, and really last.  They are comfortable and the pull up strap on the back and the metal lace eyes are nice features. The shoe's sole is long lasting and has good grip on wet surfaces and soil, yet does not have large cavities to collect soil, a good balance between semi-dress and work.  This is my third pair of this exact shoe, I like to keep one pristine, one to shop, and one for the yard. I will be ordering another in the future.

I especially like this pair because they are black and silver. The fit is true to size and they look pretty sharp on. Plus it only takes a day of wearing them so break them in. The material is soft, almost suede-ish. They are great for long walks and the insole in so cushiony soft.

These are 7-1/2 wide, and they seemed small when I took them out of the box, but they fit *perfectly*. I'm amazed! I tried them out yesterday with a three-mile walk (country road, dirt road, rocky and rutted dirt road, up and down hills) and they were so comfortable. My feet didn't get the least bit sore and I've been having some problems with sore feet. I was wearing fairly thick cotton socks, too. My only comment would be that the laces are a little short, and could be about six inches longer to allow for a good tie."

Though I'd not had much prior experience with the Skechers brand, I took a chance based on other Amazon reviews and purchased these last week, right before a trip to Europe where I knew I'd be doing a lot of walking.  They arrived the morning of my trip; I wore them right to the airport, and pretty much didn't take them off for the duration of vacation. They were amazingly comfortable from the moment I put them on - no breaking-in period necessary.  I walked over 10,000 steps in these shoes each day (one day I hit 25,000!) over miles of different terrain, including many, many cobblestones, and my feet still felt great at the end of the day.  These shoes are very cushioned, lightweight, and more stylish-looking than I'd expected - less like sneakers and more like a sporty shoe/boot."

Suddenly, they're hard/stuff and have ZERO arch support - Skechers have always had excellent arch support.  The only reason I'm giving two starts is A) Because they're black, as shown, and B) Because they came in under 2 days.  Are these some sort of twisted knock-off, or did aliens invade my porch, steal the real shoes, and leaved these?  TOTALLY NOT HAPPY!!!  Returning."

I fell in love with Skechers a few years back when I managed to snag a pair on clearance.  Previously, I was hesitant to spend this much money on a shoe. I have a really bad back, 8 herniated discs and stenosis, and patellofemoral pain (runner's knee) so comfort is important, but SUPPORT is even more important.  Without proper support, I can only last a few hours, and then I can't walk or stand up straight.  These shoes are comfortable ALL day. They provide great support so I don't hurt at all, not my back, not my knees, I can stand up straight and walk and keep going! I also wear them while working out. My last pair lasted me 4 years.  I rotate which shoes I am wearing which helps their longevity, but even still, FOUR YEARS!  And I still wear those for yard work, they just popped a seam so they look a little disheveled, but the support is still good.  I'm expecting the same from this new pair.  I love them!"

It took me months to want to wear them again because the first time i wore them, they were very uncomfortable on my one foot that I have issues with. When i had to start wearing them cause my old shoes were too bad to wear, they finally broke in until they were comfortable. However, right away, the seam started to seperate on the side of my one shoe, right now, it is running along the whole side. The rubber on the outside if the shoes is disappointing, they are just glued and they started to seperate right away as well. I thought that was going to be more of an issue than the seams but I  was wrong!  I have to do a lot of walking, bending, kneeling at work and these shoes could not handle it. Normally, I can buy a pair of sketchers and they would last well over a year, these just did not cut it. Very disappointing!"

Had a pair some years ago, but was only able to locate a cheaper looking version to replace them until I saw these on Amazon.  For a boot-type sneaker, they are light, durable and stylish.  Pretty good arch support, with room for orthotics if you need them.  I would say the fit is close to size, though I'm able to wear a half size smaller in most Skechers styles than I do in other shoes."

I'm big on reviews because I hate wasting money. I did lots of searching and came across Skechers first a white pair but I bought the wrong size and was going to surprise her with them. She didn't want white being a nurse and dealing with blood they would be red. So I sent them back and did a little more searching and found these. I'm glad I did because she loves them and she has got so many compliments from her co-workers that they look great. So I would say all around good deal and worth the money.

I sent it back and ordered the size 6 which fit perfectly. I wore these on a trip to Europe over the past three weeks and absolutely loved them. I have issues with plantar fasciitis and some neuropathy and found that they were extremely comfortable. The rose gold trim was a nice touch to an otherwise ordinary black sneaker with a white sole.

It wasn't too wide, but the sides didn't offer as much support as I'd like for my workouts.  That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  (Treadmill 2 miles, lift weights, stretch).  After a week, I decided they felt too loose in the side-support, even though I tightened the laces (a lot).  These are great for daily running around, but I won't wear them for my long walks/hike (4 miles) or workouts. Perfect for the airport/travel days (lightweight, breath well, mushable into a side pocket of suitcase).  Super cushy insoles.  Fabulous pink color!  No 'hot' spots on my heel or pinky toes (where I normally get blisters).  Arch support seems average.  Not too 'low' over my toes - so I can lift and wiggle them comfortably.  The ankle and heel area is not to high (not poking my ankle bone, or Achilles tendon area).  Easy to get on and off.  If they're like my other Sketchers, I will toss them in washer when they get grungy looking."

The toe area of the shoe is wrinkled and they got dirty and stained on the first wear. I am afraid to throw them in the washer because it feels like the heal area is constructed from cardboard and will disintegrate in the washing machine. The rose gold embellishment has already started to flake off with only 3 wears.  I needed them for a trip and didn't have time to return and replace them, otherwise, I would have. Stay away from the white. The picture is of the shoes on their 4th wear. I literally put them on to walk to my car and then into my office and back to my house. They should not get stained this easily. I have never had white tennis shoes get this stained and dirty looking this fast."

The right front one was more square and the left was more roundish and you could definitely tell the difference, so I had to return them.  I was surprised since Skechers has a good reputation.

Skechers,for Work Women's Synergy Sandlot Alloy Toe Lace-Up Work Shoe,B00NLI8FU0,R32OIB077NRAPF,"September 26, 2016",5,Love love LOVE these shoes!!,"I needed to get steel-toed shoes for work if ever want a higher paying job, so I figured I would order these and have them broken in by the time I really need them.  I noticed at work that these were the most commonly worn shoes among the females, so I figured that must be a pretty good sign. I am not at all disappointed in my shoes.  I have problems with my ankles already, any additional weight is never helpful so being lightweight is a definite bonus, being weighed down is never a good thing for me.  These shoes are as light as my running shoes.  They do run a bit wide, so if you have very narrow feet, I would keep that in mind.  However, I have ""average"" feet and being a little wide has worked in my benefit because now the shoes don't run against seem of my socks that always seems to run across the tops and sides of my toes that makes wearing anything uncomfortable.  If you need arch support, I would highly recommend using an insole that you trust, these shoes don't offer much in the way of arch support, but don't let that stop you because everything else is worth it. I am glad that I got these shoes when I did because I had to use a pallet jack at work and if I hadn't been wearing these shoes, it surely would have run over my toes when I had trouble stopping the pallet jack because of the weight of the item I was moving.  Thanks to these shoes, my toes were perfectly protected, but also allowed me to give a review of this aspect as well. I have already decided, whenever I need to replace my shoes (because let's face it, shoes don't last forever, especially if you wear them all the time), I will be ordering these again."

Steel toe boots or shoes are a must have!  Having wider feet, most steel toe shoes pinch my toes.  These however do not!  They have ample space in the toe area. When walking the floor, the cushioned insole, means my feet aren't hurting by the end of the work day.  The slip resistant sole works as described.  Often times we find water on the floor, the sole of these shoes with it's slip resistant properties, keeps me from loosing my footing. These shoes have a composite toe, unlike traditional ""Steel Toes"" these shoes do not weigh as much, but have the same rating as traditional steel toe shoes.  The lining of the shoe is comfortable and fairly thick.  The heel of the shoe is wide, to prevent tipping over. Overall these are a stylish, comfortable shoe to wear if you are working in an environment that requires you to have steel toe shoes.  The price point is right on.  I would recommend these shoes for any lady who has a wider foot, needs the toe space and would like the comfort that these shoes provide."

When I go to a shoe store, they say that I am an 8 1/2 Wide, but never have 8 1/2 Wide shoes fit me. It's like shoe makers don't take into account that even though my foot is wide, it is also thick and there is no special size for 'thick and wide' feet. I also have a bunion on my right foot which makes it even more difficult to buy shoes because my right foot is much wider than my left due to the bunion. I was hoping that the reviews that said these particular shoes fit bigger than they said they did was correct. For me, this was not true. The insert they have is alright, but not enough arch support. My feet have stretched them out over the last week and so now they fit a bit better, but not 100% the way that I would like them too. I can stand with them on for hours and even go for walks with them on. Update - I have been wearing these shoes for work which is 10 hour days on concrete floor. I think the hardest part I had when I started wearing these shoes was that they were different from what I was used to. The last pair of shoes I wore had higher arches so that was a huge difference. Now I wear these shoes on my days off because they are so comfortable. It's been over 5 months now and they are in great shape still! I will definitely buy these again."
Skechers,for Work Women's Synergy Sandlot Alloy Toe Lace-Up Work Shoe,B00NLI8FU0,RIZTU1L80MNOD,"May 29, 2017",5,Work shoes that feel like tennis shoes!,"I got these because my Keens that I bought 6 months ago were making me build calluses on my big toe, causing them to go numb. These are SO comfortable, I am going to stick with Skechers permanently for my go-to work shoe. I own several pairs of Skechers Bobs and tennis shoes, that I knew my size. They fit perfectly. These leave lots of room in the toe department (I didn't order the wide) so you don't get nearly as much toe sweat and your toes have room to stretch; I think this is important when you are standing on your feet for 8 hours straight. The cushioning is wonderful, as with every pair of Skechers I've ever owned. I think my toes might go back to normal after a few months of wearing these.

Skechers,for Work Women's Synergy Sandlot Alloy Toe Lace-Up Work Shoe,B00NLI8FU0,R15U84WRVXNRG4,"August 7, 2017",4,"Nice comfy, stylish work shoe, runs a bit big",I purchased these for work were I was required to wear a steel toe/composite shoe. My feet are small so it's hard to find my size in the store. I've been wearing these shoes for almost a week and have had no problems at all with them. They are comfy and light wearing wich was important since I haven't worked full time in a very long time and it's a pretty physical job. The last thing I needed would be heavy shoes bringing me down towards the end of the day. These are cute and stylish. Comes with pink and black shoe strings so you pick which ones you want to use. My only complaint is they run a bit big just like others have mentioned. I went back 1/2 size and they are still a little bit big. I should have went a full size. But still not uncomfortable to wear. It might be nice if my feet swell on long days. I'm assuming these will hold up since sketchers is a pretty good name. But if they don't I will change my review.
Skechers,for Work Women's Synergy Sandlot Alloy Toe Lace-Up Work Shoe,B00NLI8FU0,R3C6BZYVXCCAUB,"November 10, 2018",1,Biggest mistake I made,"I was in need of a new pair of shoes for work, I'm a waitress. I sat for hours searching different shoes so that I could find the perfect pair. I came across these and I kept going back to them. Also money is a little tight so i had to make the right choice because i could only afford 1 pair of work shoes. They seemed to have everything I needed. In the past I had a pair of sketchers that had the memory foam in them and they were the best shoes ever and I wore them until I no longer could wear them. They came in and I started wearing them to work, I realized fast I made a huge mistake. They are a little heavy but that didn't bother me. They gave me these sores on the top of one how on both feet.  The shoes were not too small or too big either. I get blisters on the middle of the bottom of my feet towards the top. After wearing them for not even a 8 hour shift my feet will hurt. There is absolutely no ventilation so my feet just sweat like crazy. I've tried to wear them so many different times for months now, again unable to afford another pair and by the time all the problems started I had them for almost a month and didn't think I could return them. This was the worse decision I made. The memory foam is only in one spot I had to buy inserts to help more. The one and only good thing about them is the non slip, that's the only thing that works great. I'm disappointed I never had a problem with any of sketchers sneakers in the past. Now I have to wear my old shoes that I wore before them that are falling apart until I buy another pair of shoes for work. Only decision I have for these sketchers shoes is should I put them in my closet to probably collect dust or throw them away. This is only my experience and opinion of them, maybe someone else had a better experience then me, I wish I did."

But my pair feels like a size and a half too big. If I didn't absolutely need them for work they would have been returned. That being said the regular width is also pretty wide. There is a good amount of padding in the heels that makes standing on the concrete floors a little better. But there isn't enough padding in the rest of the shoe. If I didn't have the option to sit when I run my machines my feet would be killing me a couple hours into my 8hr shift. Overall, too big and just ok."

Very comfy.,Worked great when I was working in a factory building windows as steel toes were a requirement. Light and stylish enough to continue wearing as I have changed careers and now work as a cna. I spend 12 hrs on my feet constantly in these shoes and they are very comfortable. So much so that I felt no reading to get any other shoe as my needs changed. My plantar fasciitis hasn’t flared since I bought these over a year ago and they are very cheap for that priceless accommodation. Would recommend to anyone.

My first day breaking them in on a 12 hour shift probably wasn't the greatest but my feet actually weren't that sore. And the next couple work days I did full shifts they supoorted nicely. I will say the toes are great and sturdy working with heavy pallets on jack and in the backroom. I gave it one less star because the nonslip isn't as great as I wish. On wet tile it isn't bad and I have no problems but wet metal or in my freezer or truck trailers where there may be a little ice and water they slip a bit but not bad. Nothing like my regular tennisshoes did. So far they're holding great I'll probably replace rhe laces they're thin and kind-of cheap. Great priced shoe well worth it thus far.

Your feet are going to sweat, even on cooler days. I've worn them in 50 degree F weather, and on days when the factory is 90 F on the inside (I live in MI, weather has mood swings like a teenager).

They are wide, so if your feet are narrow, your feet will be swimming in them.  The size is seems true, but because they are so wide, they seem larger than the size. I usually wear 7.5 and in some shoes 8.0. I ordered both. I ended up wearing the 7.5.  I gave the size 8.0 to a co-worker who wears 8.0 to 8.5.  Thick socks are a must if they are a bit too roomy, otherwise, the feet can get a bit sore from sloshing around. I wear these all day, no problem, lots of standing and walking."

My pinky toe keeps hurting. How a shoe can fit loosely and tight at the same time is beyond my understanding. And I thought the sole was supposed to be ""memory foam""? Why's it so hard? My heels and toes hurt badly when in these. Also, it isn't all that slip-resisting. I almost slipped at work twice now, gave me the fright of my life. (I had 3 knee surgeries and the worst thing that should happen to me is falling down and probably breaking something). I'm gonna go get me some nonslip crocs."

I wore these 5/6 days a week, 10-14 hours per day, walking minimum 5 miles a day and the only reason I feel I need new ones is the lining under the balls of my feet has finally worn through.

I bought this initially for my work environment that is known for water slicks and moist floors - that wreak havoc with traditional gym shoes that slip and cause sticky trips.  Not only are these awesome on slick floors, but for hiking on mossy terrains, moist rocks and other environments that Utah can throw at any avid explorer; making me be able to focus on my Search and Rescue work and not gauge whether my next step will have me slipping during a callout.  Would BUY AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN.  There is ample room for orthotics and comfort insoles."

I am so pleased with how much better my feet feel after a long day in a busy restaurant kitchen. I can see why some people think they are a little heavy but it's hardly noticeable to me. The alloy toe gives lots of wiggle room and the insoles are great on my high arches. I was attracted by the cute colors but not having achy feet makes it totally worth the cost. I plan to buy more and maybe try some other styles in this brand. Update: They lasted a year before the sole finally detached. I was very hard on these shoes so I definitely got my money's worth.

I fall almost every week so I was really banking on these really being non-slip. They are!  Love the steel toe because I do a lot of breaking down cardboard, kicking doors open, lifting/dropping things, etc.  Steel toe makes the shoe a bit bulky and heavy, but I promise you'll get used to it after a week or two.

Not too heavy, plenty of room in the toe box.  I can't speak for the arch support since I pulled out the insoles and added a pair of orthotic insoles.  My only complaint is the heel is on the wide side.  I got my normal size 8 1/2M.  With normal socks, my heel does slide around when walking.  I could wear two pairs of socks, or thicker socks, but then my feet would get too hot.  So now I'm on the hunt for thicker, not too hot, socks."

I never expected them to be the absolute BEST shoes for comfort and longevity! I work 16-18 hour shifts on my feet and these hold up to all of it!

When I first tried the shoe on it felt extremely narrow. But after wearing it several times all day I have realized how comfortable it is.

People were soaking their feet, crying because they hurt so bad. At the end of it all, I had one very small blister.  I also didn't get shin splints which is amazing.

I was looking at shoes that would provide lots of cushioning.  I have a knee problem right now that need that.  These shoes give quite a bit of cushioning.  I'm not sure if it's the memory foam or the air cushioned soles (or maybe both) that are providing the cushioning, but these shoes are just what I was looking for.  Very comfortable!  Knee feels much better when I walk in these shoes.  I ordered 1/2 size up from my normal athletic shoe size after reading the reviews and that is perfect for me.

I've worn the  sketchers premiums since 2007. I float between an academic medical center, shock trauma hospital and 2 smaller hospitals working anywhere from the ER to med surg to ICU.  I used to work do 5 12s at least. I got this in sale and thought I'd try them. Usually I wear a shoe for a year or more but I chose to rotate these with my old premiums and newer premiums. After 4 months, the memory foam is useless. I wear these maybe 1-2 times a week. I work in different areas but on my feet am awful lot. I've also been sick so I work 8 or 12hr shifts 3 times a week this year it less. I won't recommend this to anyone working 3 12s UNLESS you plan to buy one every other month.

I have Plantar fasciitis and I have tried and spent a small fortune on other shoes and brands. My feet usually hurt so bad that by noon im walking on the sides of my feet to avoid pressure on the bottom of my foot.... which was in turn killing my knees and legs. These shoes are amazing !!!! I can go all day without even thinking about my feet for the most part. They are the best shoes i have ever owned as far as comfort goes. I tell everyone I know about about them.
Skechers,Sport Women's Skech Air Run High Fashion Sneaker,B07MKPK8ZH,R12DTPBNL7H2UC,"November 10, 2016",2,Lasted Only 4 Months,"I bought these on May 27th, so I started wearing them early June when they arrived. I have been wearing them for about 28 hours a week ever since. Mainly short, non-soft carpet and concrete sidewalks (most of the time in dry, cool weather). At first, these shoes were quite comfy. The bumpy bottom has kind of a massaging quality about it, especially when walking. I don't run very often at all, but I do walk fast all the time. It's kind of a habit. The memory foam is quite cushy, especially in spots on the feet where there is less weight bearing down on it. It's still like that, and it what I like most about it. However, it started hurting my feet in late September, and it's grown worse since then. I don't wear any other shoes until my shoes wear out. Now I need to get new shoes already. In just a matter of 1 or 2 hours, my feet ache. I'm not buying these again, because I need shoes that last longer than this. I've had $20 Champion brand shoes from Payless Shoesource last 6 months, and I paid $52.99 for these shoes that lasted only 4 months. I wanted to get away from the Champion-quality by paying more and choosing a brand I once loved for its long-lasting shoes. But maybe I'll give Sketchers one more shot by getting a different style. You can't judge a company by just one product. You gotta test your... footing. ...Yeah, that was a bad pun. Sorry. Two more things to add: One: Once those ridges wear down like an eraser on a pencil, there's a high potential of slipping on wet surfaces like the white-painted stripes on crosswalks and wet, covered parking lots. I've almost lost my footing several times, and that's saying a lot because I have good balance and am careful with my footing. Two: Inside the shoes, they wore out similar to how Champion shoes do, which is the reason for my foot pain. The sole sinks in, which is worsened by the outside bottom bumps wearing out in places, and certain spots get rubbed out and create holes, revealing a hard shell-like interior hiding just underneath the memory foam. After trying out three different brands so far, I've found that anything with memory foam will have that hard shell. Since memory foam doesn't seem to last long at all due to getting flattened by 135 lbs of body weight over time, I'm coming to believe it's the same way for every brand. And that's unfortunate, because I like memory foam. But until it's fixed so that it doesn't disintegrate so quickly like cotton candy and shoes are filled with layers of varying types of foam, I'm thinking I'll soon go down the non-memory-foam shoe route and wear some kind of gel insoles."

I am normally a size 6.5 just about everything, and bought according to my size. They are so tight! Very unfortunate because I put inserts in my shoes to scale down the stinky shoe smell. I know gross. The shoe was pretty tight before I put the inserts so, therefore was even more tight with them. I decided to wear the inserts and knew I could get used to the feeling. I am glad I did!

The inside memory foam support is not too firm as to cause pain to my low arch, but also not so squishy that your foot sinks to the bottom and therefore has no support at all.

Skechers,for Work Women's Eldred Shoe,B00PJYW9V0,R2M7L2VB2GUAML,"April 17, 2017",4,A comfortable shoe,"I have owned these before. Even though they say ""relaxed fit"" they fit pretty snugly. They are comfortable to wear and walk in. I like the memory foam insoles and although in the pictures it looks like the S and the design are pretty showy, they are not that obvious. Also, be aware that the tongue is attached along the lace area, so the sides do not separate much. It can be a little snug getting your foot in with a thick sock."
Skechers,for Work Women's Eldred Shoe,B00PJYW9V0,R25MF247TDLVJT,"January 5, 2019",2,Loved them until...,"I loved these shoes when I first got them.  These were the second pair I had purchased... I actually left the first pair in the bathroom when I changed after work, and they were either stolen or thrown away.  But I loved them enough to buy another pair.  They were very comfortable.  However, in only three months time, of part time work, one of the seams just unraveled and there is not enough material there to have it repaired.  Very disappointed in the lack of quality and poor workmanship in these shoes.  Skechers, I expected better!"
Skechers,for Work Women's Eldred Shoe,B00PJYW9V0,R1USGTN0ETTU12,"April 1, 2016",5,Most comfortable sneakers on earth (according to me),I got these for dog walking on rainy days.  Super-bouncy and comfy!!  Best thing is that they will never leave my feet soaked like mesh sneakers always do.  The tongue is stitched in place also to keep out anything that can soak your socks.  My daughter tells me that they are kind of ugly but for me that is not the most important factor to consider.  I find myself reaching for them even when it is not wet outside because I know I will enjoy the walk more if my feet don't hurt!
Skechers,for Work Women's Eldred Shoe,B00PJYW9V0,R2V3UBARC31UOE,"January 23, 2016",5,Great weightless work shoes,"This is my 4th pair of Skechers for Work Women's Eldred Fresno Oxford, I love them they are weightless and so comfortable. I stand on my feet on hard concrete  & tile floors all day at work, these shoes help make the day more comfortable. I would definately recommend them, I am after all on my forth pair. They do last long too I just buy thm two pair at a time usually."

She loves these work shoes for running around as a waitress. They are very safe on greasy floors, and from day to day use they are extremely comfortable. I cannot speak for longevity of the shoes yet, but so far they still look brand new. (roughly 2 months old now). Usually after about 6 months they are done so we can only wait and see. The sizing is pretty straight forward. I would recommend these for work shoes."

I could even walk confidently on ice this past winter. I always feel light on my feet and well cushioned/supported when wearing them! I have recommended them to others.
Skechers,for Work Women's Eldred Shoe,B00PJYW9V0,RAQQ61G8IUC2C,"November 10, 2016",5,My daughter's feet don't hurt.,"My daughter just started a job where she is on her feet for 5 hours at a time with very little break.  Her feet were hurting at the end of each shift, so I did some research using nursing shoes as my search criteria.  After reading reviews, comparing prices and looking at overall specifications of the shoes, I chose these.  After a few days, I asked her how the shoes were working out and she replied, ""My feet don't hurt.""  So, thank you to the many people who posted reviews to make my selection process easier.  I am doing the same in the hope that I may help someone else facing the same decision."
Skechers,for Work Women's Eldred Shoe,B00PJYW9V0,R1IYHUBLIYYIE6,"July 8, 2016",1,Not recommended!,Be aware that the tongue of the sneaker is stitched down right up to the opening for your foot. You have to really point your toes and then wiggle your foot to get them on. These have laces but they are more for show. You cannot adjust the tightness/looseness over the top of your foot. They also lack arch support.
Skechers,for Work Women's Eldred Shoe,B00PJYW9V0,R1SHCHN0P3KR9S,"September 15, 2018",1,Insole is 2 sizes too small~~~~,There is no way to skip the fit of this shoe.  It fits but the INSOLE SUCKS.  I asked the question as to how high the heel is.  Was told over 1 inch--not so-it is barely 1 inch.  That I could take but the insole is 1/2 inch SHORTER THAN THE INSIDE OF THE SHOE and also Narrower than the shoe in front of the arch.  Long toe is hanging off the front of the insole and small toe off the edge!!!  Beyond comprehension as to why a shoe would be made size 9 with a size 7 insole.
Skechers,for Work Women's Eldred Shoe,B00PJYW9V0,R1CAI69YXESSBL,"September 6, 2016",3,When I first received these shoes I was extremely happy with them,"When I first received these shoes I was extremely happy with them. I could wear them right away without the pain of breaking them in and had all day support. After a few weeks my views changed though as my foot and shin pain returned and all support seemed to disappear. I work 40+ hours a week and am on my feet 90% of the time, but I expected a much longer lifespan. After about 3 months of wearing them I started to have painful feet after only 2 hours of working and it has gone downhill from there. A good thing that these have going for them is that they are lightweight and I haven't had any issue with slipping."
Skechers,for Work Women's Eldred Shoe,B00PJYW9V0,R2CT7J4OK5Z9MC,"June 21, 2017",5,Great for people in the service industry.,"I buy these shoes for work. I work 40 hours as a waitress and these are very comfortable. I purchased a size 11 E (wide). They are not stiff, and very light weight. When I buy a pair of shoes, I usually end up with a blister on the back of my foot (where the top of the shoe rub hits the sock). Well, I didn't have this problem at all. The shoes are very low cut and have memory foam insoles. This is the second time I've purchased this style and the only downside I can say is that after about 5 months the back sides of the shoe started to fall or sink on the inner parts.... Not sure if that makes sense, but that's the only way I can think of to describe it. Unfortunately I do not have a pic from my last pair, but will try to remember to update with a pic if it happens again. BUT, these are still great shoes. I work 40 hours as a waitress and walk more than 10,000 steps a shift. And these shoes have kept up. And, I've read you're supposed to buy new shoes every six months or so, so going buy that, these shoes are great. They are slip resistant even after a year of wearing them, and also electrical hazard safe as long as your whole shoe is not saturated with water. Recommended. Great for service industry workers."
Skechers,for Work Women's Eldred Shoe,B00PJYW9V0,R2EG6W20G1CDLR,"October 9, 2019",3,Not what they used to be,"Although I have bought Sketchers for many many years now, and I truly love the traction that I get with them. Working in a kitchen floors can be very slippery if not for these shoes. I saddened by the fact that they no longer have the same comfort level that they used to have. The memory form insert is much much thinner now then it used to be and the arch support has not gotten any better. I stand on a concrete and tile floor for 8 to 10 hours a day and I need the comfort they used to have. Now I buy these shoes then have to rip out the insert and buy more that are more comfortable. That's an added expense of another 18 to 20 dollars. They are to shallow to just add another insert on top of whats there. Will have to start looking for another brand to get what I need. . These are great shoes for walking and other normal wear, just not for the working women anymore IMO."

I didn't want to spend a lot of money on white shoes, since I only need them while in school, but I still wanted comfortable shoes. I spent a lot of time on my feet and these shoes worked  out well. They fit my feet and i didn't end up with achy feet or blisters. I have ridiculously high arches and I struggle to find shoes that fit well without squeezing the tops of my feet and leaving my toes tingly or numb. However these shoes worked great. I was very impressed, especially for the price. My only complaint is that they lack arch support from underneath so I just grabbed some inserts, but that is pretty normal for me."

Which means do not go outside when it's rainin. These shoes have ruined everything. My feet, hands, body parts, clothes, walls, floors, etc. we're DYED BLACK! And it's impossible to get off. And there's no way of getting ahold of anyone to complain or request a refund. Or a carpet cleaning for that matter!!!"

I needed all white shoes for my nursing clinicals. The memory foam soles provide all day comfort. I normally wear wide shoes, but since these aren't offered in wide, I just went up a half of a size. There is plenty of room for my toes and they are actually pretty cute! This has been my third pair of nursing shoes. I've tried nurse mates and clogs from Payless. Neither of them are as comfortable as these shoes. I'm recommending them to everyone in my cohort."
Skechers,for Work Women's Eldred Shoe,B00PJYW9V0,R2R2OPJX2CFHX,"July 23, 2017",5,Soft as butter,"I finally found a work shoe that will take on and ease the daily abuse my feet are exposed to in a hospital cafeteria. I have been suffering so long with decent, but imperfect fitting shoes. The first day I wore these Skechers, I thought, ""ah, soft as butter."" These (relaxed) shoes don't have that bulky, work shoe feel that I know so well, but still I know my feet are well supported, especially in the arch. Each day, I bend, kneel, lift, stand, walk, stop on a dime, step up, step down, you name it, I don't stop except during the lunch period when I'm cashiering. Then, it could be two straight hours of standing in one place. These shoes have passed the test, and are the best thing for my feet. I feared a break-in period, but that fear was unfounded. The first day I wore them there wasn't a trace of discomfort, as previous work shoes have caused. And I've been leaving work without limping from sore feet! I got lucky with these shoes. I wear a six 6 wide, and that's what I ordered. Ever see the ugly shoes offered for wide feet? ugh! These shoes are simple and cute. I am incredibly pleased and so relieved to have found shoes that fit my feet perfectly. Thank you, Skechers!"
Skechers,Women's Gratis-Strolling Sneaker,B07FDCNBWZ,R1G8MC6TTPT8KJ,"July 1, 2019",2,"Shoes make ""crunchy sound"" when you walk","After I received these shoes, I tried them on (to see if they fit) & put them away to be used at a later time. When I did bring them out to wear, I noticed that each time I took a step, the shoes made a noise - a kind of ""crunchy"" sound. Upon closer inspection, I could only surmise that the insoles were not completely attached to the bottom of the shoes. This is unfortunate because, the shoes are great looking & comfortable (hence the 2 stars) but I'm unable to wear them. It's also past the date of returning them."

I had them for awhile but wore a different pair to work because I stand and run around all day.  I didn’t think they would be good. After The other shoes kept hurting my feet and every shoe I tried still hurt my feet.  I finally wore them to work. My feet were soo comfortable and never hurt. After awhile the inside stared wearing down. Expected in my line of work.  I tried to wear many other shoes again. Brand never tried before. They started to do a lot of damage to my feet and legs.  Legs were going numb.  I kept feeling like I sprained a muscle in my foot. I was on a mission after that to get these same shoes.  I will not buy any other shoes for work!!! So excited they came!!!

I have not found any footwear that I can wear comfortably.  I am so very pleased that I found these sneakers that are Sketchers. Will keep buying them as long as I can walk.  They are really a 5 star for me.

From the moment I put them on, I felt like I was walking on a cloud. So comfortable I wore them every day to work until I wore them out. When I was ready to replace those, that exact model was no longer available, so I got a similar one and, although not as comfortable as the first pair, they were pretty good. This is the third pair I got and, of course, the other models were not available. These are visually nice but do not have much cushioning and the top of my foot gets a mark on it after wearing during the day since they are tight on top (and I work at an office, so more sitting than walking). When I get home, my feet are screaming and achy. I don't know why the models from before are no longer sold but I find the quality has been going downhill ever since. I still wear them but with very thin socks and if I don't have to go the whole day with them. It's a shame because the first pair I had was wonderful."

My right foot is another story but it has what appears to feel like a bone growing downward on the sole of my feet, ball of foot. I will probably not solve this without medical attention but even my right foot hurts less than before. I think these insoles are worth a try since you really do need to give these types of solutions time. I already have prescription orthotics but they didn't solve my problem."

Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk Slip-On Walking Shoe,B006FAXA5G,RMLOY2C7YN8JO,"November 18, 2017",5,Love the Original Go Walks,"Love the Original Go Walks... the fabric fits like a glove, very pliable, breathable, and comfortable.  THIS shoe is what got me hooked on Go Walks.  You cannot beat them for comfort... The Resalyte sole is like walking on marshmallows...Got each Sister a pair for Christmas... they will love them !!"
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk Slip-On Walking Shoe,B006FAXA5G,R1IQK0MMMVCE3D,"September 18, 2017",1,DO NOT RECOMMEND,"I've bought Skechers Go Walk shoes previously and LOVED them - they were so comfortable with cushioned THICK rubber-like soles. These are cheap, flimsy versions with thin, plastic soles - felt like walking barefoot - you could feel every pebble.  No support whatsoever - my feet hurt and I cannot wear them.  Despite the look of the sole, they felt like cheap dime store shores.  Really disappointed in the chintzy quality, as I have always bought Skechers athletic shoes and Go Walks previously.  Apparently they have changed the quality drastically. I wish I could get my money back but I wore them."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk Slip-On Walking Shoe,B006FAXA5G,R1G2PXAUAQNQRK,"March 4, 2016",5,"Like slippers, in good ways and bad","Pros: 1. Feel like slippers, SO comfortable 2. No break-in time 3. Rubber soles, easy to walk very quietly, sneak up on people 4. Throw in laundry, air dry Cons: 1. Look like slippers, ultra-casual 2. Wear like slippers, get misshapen 3. Soles wear through in a few months 4. Light color fabric stains easily"
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,RKNM44D0L3XA7,"June 17, 2019",5,Once you try these you will know...The comfortable level is amazing!,Last time I wore sketchers I was in 8th grade. A lot of the styles are not something I would normally gravitate towards but I was looking for a comfortable sneaker and tried on many brands in many stores. I could not stop thinking about the soft insole and the comfortable foot forming foam. I felt like I was walking on soft clouds. I’m all done wearing uncomfortable shoes that only look good but make my feet hurt by the end of the day! These are the way to go. I’m hooked and need more. I’ve worn them to the gym and on a long vacation doing a lot of walking. I’ve broken them in and they are still holding up pretty comfy. I’d suggest trying on in the store to find your size and then purchasing online. These were twice as much in store than on Amazon!
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,R2NK9P66UY9BW7,"May 4, 2019",5,Fit my wide feet like a glove!,I hate shopping for shoes because I have wide feet. I've needed a good pair for a few years but I've put it off because shopping for shoes is frustrating. My size is never in stores. I did a lot of research and I liked these shoes because they seemed like they would mold to my feet. I also liked the stretchy/breathable fabric and the no lace slip on feature. All I could hope was that the standard wide size would be sufficient for me. The moment I put these shoes on they fit like a glove. Light and easy to slip on but got nice and snug. I love these shoes. I have found my walking shoe. I highly recommend! Will buy again and again! Thank you Sketchers!
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,R245C3I714FNUR,"October 21, 2019",5,These are great shoes for the disabled,First off I don't wear tennis shoes because my feet swell so bad.  These are the first tennis shoes I can wear with socks that do not hurt my feet.  I am disabled and walking is very difficult for me I use a cane or wheelchair.  These shoes have been a blessing for me and I have worn them almost everyday since I got them.  They have great support and I can feel The support when I walk.  I have been using a slip on sketchers loafer type shoe for years.  They don't offer much support and they are ugly. Needless to say I donated them and am so happy with these shoes.  I seriously love them and they have really helped me. I walk better barefoot than with shoes on but I actually walk fairly well with these shoes on.  I just bought my second pair in a different color. The fact that I don't have to continuously adjust shoe strings is so nice ( because of my swelling feet)  but they also always feel nice and comfy.  I'm so happy with this purchase and can not say enough.  I don't need wide shoes sho I just bought the regular width they fit me perfect.
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,R23827UX82I7FA,"September 11, 2019",5,Love this shoe,Love them! ! Very comfy. I was worried they were too tight at first as i have a super high arch but within an hour had stretched to perfect fit.
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,R2DC5QOEX77XDO,"July 22, 2019",5,Love them,"Wanna feel like your walking on clouds... buy these shoes, slip them on, walk around about 10 minutes to let your feet mold the memory foam and poof... you will feel what I'm feeling right now. Oh how my tired tootsies needed these sneakers. Yay! Also don't worry if they feel a bit tight at first, it's the memory foam..."
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,R2M0PQUQSE0G2O,"August 25, 2019",5,Like walking on air,I bought these to walk around Washington DC.  We were walking about 8 miles a day.  These shoes helped a ton.  I am not crazy about the colors but the memory foam is great.  The only thing I didn't like was that they got hot but that's all memory foam it seems like.
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,RQDKAMFV6XAVR,"October 5, 2019",3,Not what I expected,I bought these same shoes from ABC and paid more so thought after them lasting 3 years I would buy them off here. I really hoped they would fit. I had the same show same size and these are too tight and the memory foam doesn't go to the edges...My review right now but somewhere else. I'm know by the way they felt today doing my errands they are not going to last and very uncomfortable. If you do buy get a size bigger I guess and wide width if you have the option with I did not.
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,R3GG83WVM7QWPJ,"August 16, 2019",5,Highly Recommended !!!! Superb.,Superb!!!! Very nice shoe pair. Very comfortable!!!! I’m in my 37th week of pregnancy. And these shoes are so comfortable during walking. Highly recommended.
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,R17CCP2EUESBFD,"July 23, 2019",5,The best sneakers ever!,These are the best sneakers i have ever had! So comfy & fit great. I have high arches & can never find shoes to fit right. The memory foam makes them amazing. Ordered my regular size & they fit great. Might even buy an extra pair to save for when these wear out.
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,RNVH701S2PNH0,"December 13, 2019",1,It feels different than my store bought Skchers,"I have a funny feeling that this is not the original Skechers. Why. Because I have three pairs of the same shoes in the past years. #1. The small “memory foam” tag is different from my previous ones. #2. The memory foam inside is really harder than my previous ones. The memory form is not flexible like the original ones. #3. I always have the size 8. The previous ones fits right in. This one feels very tight. #4. The price is about $20 cheaper than the original ones. #4. The package box is different. I just bout another one from J C Penney one week ago on Black Friday sale. That is the reason why i can tell the difference above. Overall, all of the above reason is to prove to you all that is is not a real Skechers that is from the original manufacturer. Please let me know if I am wrong on these shoes. I will be glad to change this review."
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,R1OMYG453T29N8,"August 10, 2019",4,Comfort,"Very comfortable, walking on a cloud, don't like laces so this is perfect, great price too. The top of shoe comes up high on the foot - I have a high arch so putting them on is a bit of a struggle. Would have got 5 stars if the tops would have a couple of stretchy bands to assist for us with high arches."
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,RVMJ58XJZZMP1,"July 18, 2019",5,Sneakers,Received today They fit just as expected  Great price !  Got an extra. 15.00 off  unexpectedly .
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,R3GQM9DOI2KY5D,"June 24, 2019",4,Too big,"I tried them on in a store, and they fit perfectly but I didn't buy them because they were a bit dirty.  Got a brand new pair from Amazon at a lower price, but they did not fit as well as the other pair.  The pair I got felt big and also gaped at the ankles. I shall try again, because it is a nice shoe. Very comfortable and has arch support. I like that they slip on, and have no laces."

I'm going to walk around the block.... but I might return them and look for something easier to put on my feet. Because I'm used to wearing Crocs, due to the ease of slipping them on my fee,t I wanted something similar and bit more nicer and cleaner looking. They feel a bit snug. Not sure if it's due to my use of wearing Crocs or my feet being messed up... I'd like some input... Will these loosen up after use ?"
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,R1HR5WYN1VLBDJ,"December 22, 2019",5,Attractive and Convenient,"I normally wear an 8 Wide so I ordered an 8.5 and they fit pretty good. The shoes are very nice looking and super easy to put on and take off. There was an adjustment period when I first started wearing them though. It felt like my feet didn't want to go all the way in to the toe area and my heel may slip out. I think that might be from the memory foam, but after about a week of wear, that seemed to have go away. Overall they are pretty comfortable shoes."
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,R3R1N3G7WJIK16,"November 3, 2019",2,Insides fell apart in 2weeks,"I bought these to take on Trip to Europe. I knew there would be a lot of walking. I didn’t wear these shoes exclusively. At 2 weeks into my trip I noticed pieces of white foam coming out when I took the shoes off. Sure enough, I had a hole under my big toe. I literally wore a hole in these shoes in 2 weeks!  The outside of shoes look brand new but inside is shot. Wish I could replace the insoles. Without replacing the insole I won’t wear these any more. Going to try to find new insoles before I throw them away. I’d have to say based on my experience, don’t waste your money."
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,RR1P5TDQ5NP8E,"October 3, 2019",4,A little too much room,It’s so cushiony inside which is nice but the cushion is raised up leaving space on either side of your foot for your foot to move around. Maybe they’ll wear in and they’ll stop?
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,R37HDBMTWS7VYG,"October 23, 2019",5,Regular shoe size could run too big,"I purchased and returned this style of shoe because it was too big.  I ordered my regular size 9.  I could stick my forefinger behind my heel into the back of the shoe. For me, reordering a size 8 worked perfectly.  They are just the right snugness and I enjoy not needing to tie  shoe laces.  Light weight and comfy.  Not certain about built in arch support. I have PF and use my own separate inserts.  The insoles are removeable but with some tugging!"
Skechers,Women's Summits-Quick Getaway Sneaker,B07H5NBN8W,R1G1ZJGAYXTZWZ,"January 8, 2020",5,I love this sneaker,I don’t normally give a great review on any sneaker I wear but I have to say they are truly supportive in every way.  I love the memory foam insole. I have a little room at the tip of the toe and it really hugs your foot.  The more I wear it the more comfortable it becomes.  I like that I don’t need to tie them before I jump on the treadmill at the gym or worry about them coming untied.  Thank you for a great sneaker I love to wear. Michelle T
Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,R19VT4AS5WORA4,"June 21, 2019",1,Big,"I love Sketchers shoes and they are all I own,but sometime in the past year or so,"" relaxed fit"" became a term that means the shoe will turn out to be huge on me. Length has not changed, but width has. I am unhappy. I take a normal medium or B but I just had to send back 5 pairs of Sketchers shoes and found out ""relaxed fit"" is not what I can wear. I am so disappointed.  These shoes were all slip- on and for summer, slip-ons  are what I wear with no socks. Relaxed Fit makes this impossible for me. Really is a problem."
Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,R2UQ6IP0TFZ5G,"May 25, 2019",3,No arch support/heel too loose,Had to return them. The heel was too loose and I got a half size smaller as some suggested. There is no arch support and they flopped off my heel.
Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,R3MB67RI1W73Y8,"June 20, 2019",3,Very wide at heel,Nice quality and look but I had to return them because they were so loose at the heel. I have several other pairs of similarly styled Skechers and didn’t have that problem. If you have wider feet at the back of fit these might be very comfy for you.
Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,RQPAMNBYDPJZO,"March 21, 2019",2,Why don't these shoemakers make shoes for people with narrow feet?,"Cute shoe.  Comfortable with the memory foam thing but they are wide as hell.  My feet look like they're swimming in these things.  I don't know, they just don't look good on my skinny feet.  I tried."

Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,RG9WX18SCOEO1,"March 3, 2019",5,fit was as stated,I liked the good feel of the shoe.  It was easy to put on and the memory foam was great.
Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,RZPVLPXGTV6WU,"February 2, 2020",5,Comfortable and attractive,Very nice and attractive shoe.  Comfortable fit.  I would say though that relaxed fit is almost like a wide width in the same size.  For slim feet you will get some room around the heels.  A bit slack in that area.
Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,R18MK1OZZUKEY,"October 29, 2019",3,The shoes definately are relaxed!,"I love Sketcher's,have several pair.These were fine when first put on,wore one day.They stretched out so much,couldn't keep on feet.I would have sent back but threw bag away they were delivered.I plan to get some inserts to make shoes tighter.It is very difficult to order shoes on line-they all fit differently."
Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,R2FV3FRZ97AT66,"June 15, 2019",1,Sad,I have worn Skechers for while now & I wanted these shoes so bad BUT the heel kept slipping. Some of the reviews  mentioned this but thought I would give them a try.  Even tried an insole but no luck. Am just sad.
Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,RL4PVW3FU7VY,"February 18, 2020",5,Super comfy,"I'm 7 months pregnant and needed something more comfortable and easy to get on for work. These are perfect! I did end up going up a half size from my normal, but they fit perfectly. The arch support is just enough, the cushion is fantastic, and they easily slip on. They are stylish and cute, and go well with my business casual work attire (mostly light sweaters and leggings at this point!). Debating buying another color, if the price drops."
Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,R30SMC1CHOM1C2,"July 6, 2019",3,"It's just another half size, is it just too hard?","Didnt get what I expected.  Too wide, too long....I'm used to this as I am a size 10.5...not many of those around. Funny how manufacturers just gave up on women after size 10.  I'll never understand it."
Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,R3SP06LXODH57U,"July 8, 2019",5,Most comfortable shoes for work!,These shoes are perfect! The fit is great and they are super comfortable with plenty of support. I can wear them at work and stay on my feet all day. I can take a quick walk at lunch without having to change shoes.
Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,R30LG65673WWEG,"November 28, 2019",3,Stiff feeling size runs big,They look cute but are very stiff and not pliable when walking. They were larger than the size I ordered that I wear.  My heel didn't reach the back of the shoe. Uncomfortable.
Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,RBTSLCYZ0T3O7,"December 7, 2019",2,Disappointing,"These do not have removable insoles.  They have thin small pieces of memory foam firmly attached.  There is no arch support.  Since I can't put an insole in, they are too big."

Skechers,Women's Breathe Easy-Good Influence Sneaker,B07J38R5VY,R3TEAF5MOMT1VM,"November 2, 2019",3,An okay shoe,These are okay. Originally ordered my normal size of 8.5 but they were too small so I returned them for a 9. They’re a little loose but okay if you wear socks meant for this kind of shoe. They’re comfortable but one of them is giving me a blister on the side of my foot.

Skechers,for Work Women's Gibson-Brogna SR Slip-On,B07MKSBTC1,RZSD9FAZNKYSU,"September 5, 2017",5,Best work shoes I owned!,"I have worn these shoes for years now, bought a few pairs already..Love them! I am on my feet a lot (I am a nurse) and wanted comfortable shoes that are made of leather so I can clean them easily with wipes, they don't get soaked through if I get something spilled on my feet or step into something on a floor (bodily fluids, anyone?? lol).They are easy to slip on, no need to fuss with shoe laces or velcro..They are round toed and wide fit so they don't rub my toes and comfortable to wear long hours, my feet don't hurt at all!! Skechers is a tried and trusted company for me for comfortable shoes for work and the price is great too!"
Skechers,for Work Women's Gibson-Brogna SR Slip-On,B07MKSBTC1,R163ZY7YCIMZRN,"January 22, 2019",1,"Nice looking shoe, but not meant for extended wear.","These shoes are very stylish and *seemed* comfortable immediately out of the box. I ordered a size 9 although I am generally a woman's 8.5, because I spent anywhere from 8-12 hours at a time on my feet and I didn't want the shoes to be too snug. After my first wear (10 hours) my feet hurt worse than they have ever felt. I purchased additional Dr. Scholls inserts to combat this problem,  however I wore them for a second time the next day (7.5 hours) and 2 days later my feet are still in excruciating pain. I fear I am developing planters fasciitis because of long hours in these shoes. The non slip grip on these sneakers is extremely effective,  however they are very loud, and make me sound like a basketball player as they squeak across the wood and tile flooring at my work. Overall, these are an aesthetically pleasing non slip shoe, but they provide very little in the way of heel/arch support and they should not be worn for more than a couple of hours at a time in an active standing position."
Skechers,for Work Women's Gibson-Brogna SR Slip-On,B07MKSBTC1,R21NJZ52M9BV9P,"January 11, 2019",1,Waste of money,"I wore these shoes for four months and they are terrible.  The backs are not soft at all and tore apart the back of my foot for a month.  I had to wear blister protection or bandaids and long socks.  Now, let it be known that I wore these shoes 40 hours a week so they did get a lot of wear but I expected sketchers to last longer than three months before getting huge holes in them.  I had to spend nearly all of December with wet feet at work because of just walking across the parking lot in the rain.  Both shoes developed holes on the outside (pictured) and the little strip kept tripping me whenever I would turn.  The right shoe started ripping in the “leather” on both the outside and top.  I had safe-t-step shoes before these that lasted for a year so I decided to go back to them."
Skechers,for Work Women's Gibson-Brogna SR Slip-On,B07MKSBTC1,R2WNPMVVUSBOBI,"June 22, 2018",2,Still slips in the kitchen and not comfortable for high arches,"I've had these for a little bit less than two months. It fit a little narrow but that's due to my wide feet. I work as a food runner in a KBBQ and the floors can get a little slippery, in and out of the kitchen. I've had a lot of non slips and had no problem with the grip of the soles except for this pair. The grip on the soles improved after a few wears but I still find myself slipping in the kitchen every now so often. I also have high arches on my feet and there wasn't a lot of arch support or cushion in these shoes. Coupled with 8+ hour shifts of running around, I find myself limping after my shifts. If I got half a size bigger, I could probably work with it if I were to get the appropriate insoles but that's another $20 or so."
Skechers,for Work Women's Gibson-Brogna SR Slip-On,B07MKSBTC1,R3B7RRIL3OM8J2,"May 16, 2015",4,Good work shoes,"Nice shoes.  Definitely not as light as some other work Skechers, but this style tends to always be on the heavier side.  I work 14 hours day at a restaurant and no complaints yet after a month.  The inside is pretty soft, and the nonslip sole definitely works.  My only complaint is that if you have narrow feet, they will fit big the sizing seems to be a bit weird.  I wear a size 8 in all shoes and ordered such but they were huge so gave them to another girl who wears size 8 wide and they fit her well.  I ordered a size 7 right after and yep, these fit perfectly.  So just beware that you might need to return before getting the right size."
Skechers,for Work Women's Gibson-Brogna SR Slip-On,B07MKSBTC1,RXGYYIU7X4KT3,"September 24, 2018",2,Just okay - Most likely got a bad right shoe.,Comfortable enough to use on the floor for up to 12 hrs. The only drawback was that the part of the shoe that rubs against my right achilles has caused serious pain (turned super red/hurt and had to shift my weight to my left side during work which resulted in a bad back for 2 days). I was trying to break them in before posting this review to see if maybe that was the solution. Only the right shoe seems to be causing this since the other is perfectly fine. I ended up cutting the part that was hurting my right achilles but in the future I'll be going with a different work shoe. Doubt I can return it since I've worn it for 2 weeks now and decided to cut the part that was hurting me. Runs a bit on the large side but okay with that since winter is coming up and thick socks are a necessity.
Skechers,for Work Women's Gibson-Brogna SR Slip-On,B07MKSBTC1,R2OG2ZRUA2KY52,"July 30, 2017",4,Pretty good for retail,"This is my third pair of these exact shoes over the last few years. I can't put my finger on it but they seem to have been redesigned just slightly. The top of the shoe seems to be a little longer and now rubs on my ankle. Also, I have always replaced the stock insole for a more expensive one and this time the stock insoles were terribly difficult to remove but I guess that is good if you're keeping those. Either way I have been pretty happy with these obviously since I've purchased them several times. I'm a retail manager and am on my feet 50-60 hours per week. I like the classic styling and the non-slip feature."
Skechers,for Work Women's Gibson-Brogna SR Slip-On,B07MKSBTC1,RSW5IFO5M7SZG,"June 4, 2019",1,Holy ouch,I’ve been on my feet walking miles for years and never needed slip resistant shoes until recently with a new job. These shoes hurt my feet so bad I hurt all over. They don’t stay on my feet very well they are the right size but since there is no way to tighten the shoe the back kind of flips off my foot. This caused blisters and it rubs so bad it rubs the bandaid off my heel by the end of the night. They are very flat and don’t bend the easiest so I find it hard to walk in them. They have zero support what so ever and the bottoms of them are rock hard. I’ve worn these shoes for about a week and refuse to put them back on. I thought I was maybe exaggerating and might of needed to break them in more but I have pain in my knees shins and hips from having to walk weird when wearing these shoes. I’m young and shouldn’t have these issues already so needless to say the shoes aren’t worth it buy a pair that are actually good for your feet not just slip resistant.
Skechers,for Work Women's Gibson-Brogna SR Slip-On,B07MKSBTC1,R2VMHPO1FTPSQZ,"June 19, 2019",1,These ARE NOT NONSLIP.  NOT restaurant safe!,"I purchased these for work (restaurant) and wish I hadn’t! I’ve purchased Sketchers numerous times, and have always been satisfied with the product, but NOT this shoe. I expected it to be a bit narrow because they don’t come in wide, but since they are a relaxed fit, I knew they would allow room for my wider feet. They only took a few days to stretch out a bit, but the back of the left shoe seems to be irritating my heel a bit more that I’d expect a new shoe to do. So, since all of this is as I expected, the reason for the low review is that they ARE NOT NONSLIP!!! I have given it a couple days, just in case there was some sort of coating on the sole that would wear off, but nope.

I noticed there were holes developing all along the edge and near the bottom of the shoes.  I tossed them.  I found some $10 non slip shoes by Avia that are better.

After reading other reviews of these shoes being inconsistent in sizing, I returned these and ordered an 8.5. I would have ordered an 8 instead but there was a $20 price difference. If the 8.5 are still too big I am returning AGAIN and giving up on these shoes.

Even worse, they are my only pair so I’m limping half way through the day and my back is now a wreck. Feet and legs swell up and I can barely walk the next day. Never had feet issues until I put on these shoes. They’re awful I’m very disappointed. Going to a work store tomorrow to find another brand and try them on first. Sad sketchers has let me down.

Those first ones mom bought lasted about a year which is pretty awesome because we have to stand and move a lot at work and shoes never last long at my work. They get all types of syrups and spills on them. These cover my feet in case of hot water spills. I think it took about a week or two for me to really break them in so I did feel a bit of pain on my feet but not so much that its painful to walk or stand. I have to stand a whole 8 hours and then I have to walk to/from work. After you break them in they are perfect. They're supposed to be only my Starbucks work shoes but I love wearing them for my caregiving job and just my everyday shoes. I just sleep my feet in and go.  And they're easy to clean. I just I just take a wet towel and wipe all the mocha spills off and I'm good Lol

They are possibly the most comfy shoes I've ever worn and fit great on my fairly narrow, size 8 1/2 feet.  For the elliptical, I don't bother wearing socks.  There is wiggle room in the toe and heel area that mesh beautifully with the demands of elliptical training.  For walks, I wear socks and these shoes are equally as comfortable.  I especially appreciate the the arch is perfect for my feet:  neither to built up or too flat.  I highly recommend these!  P.S.  They are nice enough looking to wear for a casual occasion, too!"

I wore them for a whole day at work without much issue (although I could feel the shoe where I'm not used to) and by the end of the 2nd day (worn only 4-5 hours) it was kind of annoying me.  Not yet to the point where it's painful but it could hurt more as time goes on.  The material that rubs against the back of my heel is set higher and thicker than any other go-walk I've had.  I decided to try them since they were 10 dollars cheaper than the GW 4 I was about to order from Sketchers, but I think that savings wasn't worth it if I'm going to have a shoe I can only wear a few hours and a few times a week.  With that said, it is a nice looking shoe and otherwise comfortable."

They do not slip up and down on my heel, have enough toe wiggle room and are just darn super comfy! I would definitely buy another pair when these wear out, or possibly sooner.

I have nasty calluses on the outter edges of my heels and my ankles are messed up. My feet are very skinny and I thought that they'd fit me well since they're narrow built. I was wrong.

Even though they fit, they rub in odd spots. They offer very minimal support and I leave work with much more foot pain than before. Also, what is it about sketchers that causes them to absolutely reek no matter what you do, in such a short period of time.

I have a very wide foot so I always have a hard time finding shoes that are truly wide. Sketchers does pretty good with this in a couple styles. This particular one is good, and the sure track wide is also good. I’ve worn these for the last three days on 10-12 hour (restaurant) shifts, and they were comfortable right out of the box. They are actually slip resistant in the FOH and BOH, just as advertised, unlike some other styles I’ve tried. I am a little afraid the softer leather may wear quickly, but I hope I’m wrong. If you’re looking for serious arch support, you’ll probably need to invest in some different insoles, but if a less prominent arch is sufficient, you’ll be fine. I will definitely buy these again...without hesitation."

Honestly, the HEEL does NOT cup your OWN heel so it's constant slipping up/down on the Heel of the shoe. As far as I Can Tell- the rest of the Shoe May Be Great!  But the HEEL slipping is ridiculous! Standing in one place MIGHT be good for these, but at some time-You Have to actually WALK in them!

These shoes look great but as others have mentioned the material of the uppers feels off, definitely cheap and I can already see the white coloring flake off. Shame they use such horrible material on a ""premium"" line. Other wise the shoe feels true  to size, they are incredibly light, the rubber outer sole is very nice. As for the inner sole, no arch support at all, no heel cup. I have to use inserts in these in order to wear them(plantar fasciitis). The inner sole does not seem to be removable either so my foot ends up losing a lot of room I should have had in these. This will probably be my last pair of skechers, they used to be all I would ever buy but really stayed losing me with the memory foam insoles."

These shoes are about the only pair I've had that keep my feet feeling well after a long walk and even a lot of standing. I have plantar fasciitis and standing and walking for long periods are rather brutal otherwise. The thickness of the bottom of these shoes means I don't feel like I'm standing directly on the concrete/pavement after a few months. They are padded all around so there is nothing to rub or irritate your feet anywhere in the shoe. These cause no issues even when breaking them in the first time...the very first time I put these on, I went for a walk for 1.5 hours and nothing bothered me at all! The only thing I wish, in a perfect world, is that they made this exact shoe without shoelaces! I have arthritis and it's particularly bad in my fingers in the morning and it can be difficult for me to tie the shoes.

I have spent a small sum trying to find the shoe that fits like the past ones, I had to buy inserts for the last two pairs, because the sole is as hard as a rock, WHAT GIVES with Skeckers comfy tennis. one pair I bought the hole where you insert foot was so tight and hard, no way to get your foot in the shoe. I returned them. The best shoe they made you can't find it anymore. the slide with no laces  and full tennis with no laces, and oh so comfy. They have also taken the arch support out of the sole, I need the support.  Please give us back our comfy shoes. If you made these leather shoes in all colors, people would be happy. all you have is white on the slides and black & white on slip on. we need blue, & brown for sure, to be able to wear them to work. I wore the new black pair and they were so hard, I had leg and back pain just from being in them 3 hours in and out to appts. The old skechers, take them out the box, put on and you never have any aches and pains. You have taken the good shoes away and given us aches and pains."

I wanted to get away from the sports/running shoe look, so I chose the black Nubuck style. These shoes remind me of the hiking shoes I bought when I lived in Germany! I did not pay close attention to the fact that the insoles are not memory foam and are not removable. I realized that the insole was too stiff for me because I require a much softer insole. The price of this shoe was outstanding, while other colors and outer material might be more expensive. The price allowed me to spend a bit more money and purchase memory foam insoles. My only caution is if you might want softer insoles, be sure that there is enough room in the shoe to accommodate the extra material, again, the original insoles cannot be removed! I usually buy a 1/2 size larger shoe because I need extra room in the footbed and toe area; therefore, I have plenty of room in the shoe to accommodate the additional insoles. Also, the shoe is very lightweight in-spite of the sturdiness of the build."
Skechers,Sport Women's Premium Sneaker,B000E7WIKY,RL0C0UILYZMP3,"May 17, 2017",4,A great shoe that doesn't work for me,"These are great shoes!  Just one problem.  My feet hurt when I wear them.  I believe the problem is with my feet, not the shoe.  I have had problems with my feet my entire life.  When I was a little girl, I had to have my shoes specially made, from as far back as I could remember until I became an adult and started buying my own shoes. Wide short feet, high instep, and flat feet.  I buy shoes all the time and they usually don't fit correctly and cause horrible pain when I wear them.  I end up having cramps in my feet, or calves, many times I wake up with my toes being drawn down from muscle spasms when I am in bed.  So imagine trying to hop out of bed to walk the cramps out when I can barely get out of bed because of the pain in my feet. In many years I have found one pair of shoes that worked and I wore them out.  Then I recently found out that they have been discontinued.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it! My advice to anyone especially buying shoes online, know your feet, know your size, width, if you have a high arch, low arch, or flat feet, high or low instep and any other little quirks your feet might have.  Do you over-pronate?  Be knowledgeable before you buy. I accessed these as ""Fit as expected"".  I have short fat ""Flintstone toes"" and almost every shoe I buy my toes feel cramped and uncomfortable.  These shoes have plenty of room for my toes and that is amazing to me, however when I wear these shoes, the balls of my feet hurt which makes my toes cramp. I will do what I always do.  I will find another pair of shoes to try and give these away. These are good shoes and wear well and are well made.  Just know your feet!"

I usually got 2 years out of a pair before they became yard and garden shoes.  I took a break from them the last few years, but decided I needed to go back to what I know fits and is comfortable.  For me they are true to size in length and width.  The arch support is not very aggressive; more in the  moderate range which is perfect for my feet.  Being leather they will stretch a bit and conform to your foot.  I'll likely keep buying these as long as Skechers makes them. My only complaint is that Skechers used to give you 2 pairs of laces -- one white and one blue to match the eyelets.  Now it's just the white.  So, I bought Delele 45 inch long oval shoe laces here on Amazon.  They come in a bunch of colors and the navy matched these shoes perfectly so I can trade out lace colors when the mood strikes me."

The fit was small and the sole was hard - I mean painfully hard. If I wore them more than 2 hours, my feet were killing me. I ended up throwing them out they were so bad. I'm honestly very confused by this. I've owned this shoe before and never had these types of problems. Was it a bad shoe, a knock off?  I don't know, but I am not happy about this."

Wasn't sure how I'd like these and I didn't. I've come to be more and more disappointed in Skechers over the years. These don't have memory foam which I don't like anyway. Another pair I have with memory foam feels like the foam is not where it should be. So the sole of this shoe feels like there is no support or comfort. It actually was hurting the ball of one foot. Walking barefoot has more comfort. I got them in all white but the white of the sneaker is duller than that of the laces. The laces stood out as if I just got new laces for older sneakers. Didn't look appealing at all. The wide width felt good. In my case I felt like the front of my foot had room to spread out. And I suspect would allow room for swelling. But it's not just wide at the front, it also felt bigger at the heel. Good for thicker socks, certainly not thin ones."

I work at the post office and am on my feet and moving all day long.  These are within my uniform requirements and are fantastically comfortable.  Some reviews say these shoes run small.  I wear, depending on the shoe brand, a 9.5 or a 10.  I got these in a 10 and they're perfect, not too big, not overly snug, but with some wiggle room for the toe and space enough at the heel to keep from rubbing.  I cannot over-recommend them! Update- these lasted about six months then started falling apart.  Amazon replaced them.  The replacement pair lasted about three months.  I wound up getting a pair that barely lasted a month and finally Amazon quit giving me the replacements and gave me a refund.  These were super comfortable but they did not hold up at all.  I must have gone through five pairs of these.  Super disappointing."

It is heavier than most walking shoes, but perfect if you are doing more than casual walking.  I walk at least an hour a day and prefer this to an even heavier hiking boot. I even wear it golfing since I cannot find a golf shoe that does not hyrt my feet.  I have a problem with bunions and the toe box is wide enough to keep the bunions from getting inflamed. If you need arch support you will likely need to get an insert .  I use an insert and it works well. I have a narrow heel, and it does not come out of the back of the shoe when walking."

I chose these, because I needed a higher heel & also good arch support. I wear a true 71/2 wide, but ordered an 8 wide & the fit was perfect. Had to give up my ryka sneakers, because the heel was too low and I did not have the stability when walking. I felt like I was going to fall. With these Skechers the higher heel gives me great stability and I can take my walks without feeling like I'm going to fall backwards. Would highly recommend to anyone who has foot problems."

They were terrific! However, they claimed to be slip resistant work shoes - this is untrue, they are very slippery with any wet surface. I slipped and sprained my ankle pretty bad while wearing them, and there was very little water on the floor."

I bought these on Amazon because my local retailer didn't have them in stock any more. I have worn these shoes for the last 10 years or so. I have plantar fasciitis and need something without memory foam and these are perfect. They are roomy enough I can put my orthotics in them and still have wiggle room. The only down side is they don't have much of an arch support (hence, why I put orthotics in). These shoes have pretty hard insoles, they are not at all cushiony so if you're looking for something squishy and soft, look somewhere else or use insoles."

I saw these had decent ratings and purchased them. I should have returned them from the start as the fit was a bit off. My heel slipped in the heel box and if I wore thin socks my entire foot slipped forward. I felt like I was walking barefoot on concrete after just a few hours in these shoes and my feet would get very hot in them. After about 4 months of use I have stopped wearing them altogether as my feet just hurt to much in these shoes. I also noticed what another reviewer stated about the color of the laces making the shoes look old, which was annoying for a new pair of shoes. Will not be buying this brand again."

In the past 7 years I have had 9 surgeries and left with a bad back, left foot has severe drop foot and right foot has a huge bunion. Yes, that was one surgery but it was done incorrectly. So as you can imagine it is very difficult to find the right sneakers with good support at a price I can afford as I am now on disability. I have been wearing these over a month. Did need to purchase arch supports but I need to on all my footwear. These sneakers are comfortable, wide enough for my bunion and can tie tight enough for my drop foot.  Practicularly a miracle considering all my issues and they alleviate some of my chronic back pain. I ordered my normal size in wide. Perfect fit. The quality of these sneakers is outstanding tho a little heavy but certainly not a problem. I have two dogs I have to walk several times a day and these sneakers make those walks much easier and less painful.

First off let me say that they fit well and are comfortable but that's about all the positives I can find. They are also clunky, heavy, and dangerously slippery on wet floors. They are also lacking in quality. Within one month the tread at the toe of my right shoe was lifting off and after three months the interior of the left shoe at the toe is literally falling apart. I used to love Skechers but the last two pair I've bought have fallen apart within months. If your looking for a good quality shoe I would recommend you look elsewhere."

They still look good, and the tread is still looking new. I had to replace them due to the firmness wearing out on the bottoms. By that, I mean, when I step on anything at all I feel it in my feet. Even a tiny pebble. Overall, however, after an estimated 850 miles of walking, I'd rate them as a pretty good value. Please note that I am not including all the standing I have done. I would consider them to be of pretty decent value. I never did fully get used to the mushiness of the inserts that come with the shoe. I gave it a long go, and by the time I got to wear the mushiness was a bit of an issue, I could not return them. Frankly, I do not think I would have returned them, either, as they are good shoes in many ways. They do have really good tread, and grip very well. As I mentioned earlier, that tread still looks new, and still grips very well, with no slippages. I find myself wishing the firmness along the bottom of the shoe had continued to remain strong enough, as they have held up well with how they look and how well they grip. Covering an estimated 850 of walking is bound to impact any shoe, so I cannot hold that against them. The one reason for 3 stars instead of 4 is the mushiness on the feet. Just a little more firmness, and there would be 4 to 4 1/2 stars, especially for the price."

I had no ideal what it was for especially on just one shoe, so I cut it off. The I think memory foam is useless in a shoe, it just flattens out, Gel or even just foam would have been better.

I normally wear a wide shoe in size 9 in the Skechers line. My first pair that were this size wore out and at that time I discovered that Skechers had discontinued that shoe in wide sizes. I went to a Skechers store where I could try on different types and sizes. Although there are a few that they still make the wide sizing in, for the most part ""wide"" had been replaced with ""Relaxed Fit"" (as was explained to me at the store). In the ""Relaxed Fit"" shoe I ended up with a size 9.5 shoe. The pair I chose was a suede type shoe, the softness of which helped with a quick break in period and much comfort. When I need a more ""work"" style shoe I went with these stiffer leather black work shoes in the 9.5 size Relaxed Fit that my other shoes are. The fit is acceptable, due to the stiffness of the leather the break in period is significantly longer and I find that I may have been able to go back to a size 9. Now that they are 90% broken in I have noticed some slipping of my heal, not uncomfortable at this point but noticable.

The only ""comment"" I have is that they are little on the heavy side, but I don't really see this as a negative because I think it is due to them being built very durably with thick soles and tread that have lots of traction, plus quality leather on top.  They're not so heavy that I notice them while I'm wearing them, but when I kick them off at the end of the day, it's more like an ""Ah, I'm definitely home from work now"" kind of notability.  If you're VERY weak in the legs due to medical issues, though, you may want to look at Sketchers' cloth-based shoes rather than these leather ones, as I wear the cloth Sketchers slip-ons at home and on casual Fridays, and they are very light weight, just not as professional looking."

I work in IT in a hospital so I’m on my feet a lot getting under desks and moving computers and equipment. The shoes are very comfortable and have good flex. They seem to get scuffed fairly easy but I just need to polish them. They tend to get hot if you wear thicker socks. If I wear my Hanes black long socks they get super hot but if I wear my thinner dress socks it's perfect. They do not slip ever. I have been using them to and from my car and into work and I have not slipped on ICE or anything else. But because of that they pick up every rock and stick you step on so just remember to tap/stomp/wipe your feet when you go into your car house or place of work. If I was rich I would by 10 pairs just in case they stop making them. The memory foam is fantastic and quality. Feels new Everytime i put my feet in.

So, he takes lots of steps. He has wide-ish feet but the toe box on these is waaay too big and allowed his feet to slide around and his toes to bang against the end.  He got many blisters after the first shift that he wore them. The second time he thought he'd wear two pairs of socks.  Well, after his second shift, his toenails were PURPLE.  The sole of his feet also hurt because there were a few harder areas on the insole. So these did not work for him at all."

He said they were the most comfortable shoe he has every worn. He works 5 days a week, 10 hours a day, 80% outside on his feet in Chicago (usually not in more than 1in. of snow but at times very wet & muddy). These shoes lasted him 1 year so far, which is a record for his work shoes. They are a little worn looking but clean & polish up well. He said his only Con is they are a little heavy in weight. (He is 71yrs old might be a factor) Quality was beyond our expectations...Great shoe, well worth a try at this price."

They are pretty comfortable too. Sizes run big I’m normally and 11 and need a size 10 with these shoes. The one thing I don’t like about them the weight. They are heavy shoes, which I’m sure adds to the durability. I am a Chef I got these as work shoes, as far as work shoes goes these cover all bases non-slip, waterproof, and safe I have dropped hot oil on my foot and thanks to these I didn’t get injured or even discomfort. I walk around a lot at work so the heavy weight of these shoes are my only complaint. However I don’t see this as an actual problem with the product it’s more of my preference which is why I rated 5 stars. I think these would be better for people that stand in the same place a lot, because they are comfortable to stand in."

He was dragging his feet about getting to the store and finding a pair he liked (rather than the pair he used to just drag out for weddings and funerals that he hated).  So I bought these online, handed them over to him and he was shocked by how much he liked them.  He says that they're comfortable for walking on his breaks, they may even be more comfortable than his sneakers.  So, very happy with them and will definitely be back to buy another pair when these wear out. :)"

I like the fact that they are comfortable and lightweight and that they go with anything. I searched for a long time to find shoes that I didn't have to match with the rest of my outfit. I was surprised to find that these shoes don't actually tie. There is an elastic band under the bow of the shoe, making them easy to pull on and off."

My grand-daughter loves them, and wears them everyday.  I ended up getting her another pair, and one for myself as well, so three pairs in all!  When your feet are in the shoes, they ride on a foam bed that feels supportive yet springy, and my feet don't get hot like they do with other sneakers.  The mesh provides ventilation.  My grand-daughter doesn't tie laces very well, so with this slip-on style she doesn't have to worry about that, and the laces are always neatly tied.  The shoe opening is just right, not too large or small, so it's easy to put on or off."

These are slip-in shoes and that really surprised me. Also, I got a wide thinking that they were going to fit snug but the wide may just be a little too roomy. I was trying to accommodate for my wide feet/chubby toes but to my surprise, these are very wide. Well, I will keep them since they are comfortable and I can get used to the slip-in concept versus having shoe strings. Not a bad purchase but a surprising one."
Skechers,Women's Ultra Flex Statements Sneaker,B074BYFLP5,R2EVT33H0IB2B7,"October 24, 2019",4,"Good fit, very light, not for walking long distances","As the title suggests, these shoes are very light and if I didn't look down at my shoes, I would have thought I only had socks on. They fit very well and I like the breathable design. These are very comfortable, but for me, they are not ideal for walking for very long.   The arch support is alright. If you really need it, I would either opt to find different shoes or find inserts. Perhaps it was because I wasn't used to walking such long distances, but I had constant problems with my feet and they felt bruised after I hit the 8-mile mark of near-constant walking. The back of the shoe, right where the top of it meets the back of your ankle, will rub constantly and cause pain after a while. I recommend putting some moleskin either on your actual skin under your sock, or on the shoe itself until you feel that part of the shoe has broken in enough. Also worthy of note, I had worn these shoes *once* before going to an airport. When I was walking through TSA checks, an alarm went off for organic matter/chemicals of some type and everything on me was searched. They swabbed my shoes and sure enough, that's what set off the alarms. I'm not sure if it was something to do with TSA's equipment or something Sketchers uses to clean off the shoes, but they should probably check that just in case..."

Even though it looks like a tie shoe, it's not. The ""bow"" is sewn into place and the laces are slightly stretchy. With a thin sock, it was a good fit. Once I tried a normal warmer sock, it was a little tight because I couldn't adjust the laces. I always buy a regular width but this seemed to be a little small. If you zoom in on the shoe, you can see the laces don't look quite right. I didn't notice it until it arrived. Not sure why Sketchers would bother making shoe that looked like it tied when it doesn't. Luckily I can return with no hassle so I didn't mind the small inconvenience."

I even double checked the label when these arrived to make sure they sent the right size because Skechers are a good shoe and have always fit right for us. I’m not sure why these didn’t.

They were comfy from the time I started wearing them. Will probably buy more, if they get more sizes in. A lot of the colors were grayed out, meaning not available in my size. Great shoes.

I wear  a medium width size 10 shoe. I ordered an 11 and it fits well. Priced right! This shoe is very much like my Nike running shoes and much much cheaper. There's enough room to wear a sock, which is nice. The insole is not as cushioned as previous Sketcher shoes I've purchased during the past 10 years. However, I added an inexpensive cushy insole & wore a low profile sock to gain more comfort. Shoe strings are sewn on and for looks only."

Skechers,for Work Women's Soft Stride-Softie Lace-Up,B0007TLSE6,R1IGKT1OKRK2Y8,"February 2, 2017",5,Not Memory Foam is the BEST,"Women's work shoes are very hard to find. This is the exact pair I bought when I first started working at my current job, about 3 years ago. They lasted about a year - which, considering I'm on my feet 50 hours a week, was incredibly impressive - but when I went to buy them again from where I got them originally (Sears, I believe) I found that they didn't make them anymore. They made an almost identical version, only the new ones had memory foam soles. I bought a pair of those to replace my originals, but found that I only got a few weeks out of them before the memory foam contoured to my foot in such a way that it didn't actually provide padding anymore. I went on a quest (both online and out in the world) to find a pair to match my originals, or just a good quality women's work shoe that wasn't memory foam and didn't have steel toes, and found that this combination was almost impossible to come by. Eventually I found these here, triple checked that they weren't memory foam, and ordered with my fingers crossed.  I was elated when they showed up and were exactly what I wanted. I've had them about 4 and a half months now and they're still going strong - again, I abuse the crap out of them, so 4 and a half months is actually pretty impressive on it's own. I'm hoping to get at least a full year out of them, though they're already money well spent for the lack of foot and back pain, and will 100% order them again when the time comes. I can only hope that these don't vanish as well before then. Maybe I'll even buy a backup pair now, just in case. These are truly a great investment for any woman who has to wear slip-resistant shoes at work and doesn't want steel-toes or memory foam. In fact, if you're looking at these and currently have memory foam, I'd highly recommend giving these a chance. Memory foam is sorely overrated, especially when you're on your feet all day long."

Standing on your feet for an 8-12 hour shift is hard on your feet, legs and back.  These shoes have worked wonders for me!  I come home at the end of a long shift and have no discomfort at all.  I have even noticed that I no longer have the need to shift my weight from foot to foot when standing in one place and that was a big problem with the shoes I wore before these. The icing on the cake is the VERY reasonable price of these shoes.  I've purchased shoes directed at nurses that range from $100-$125 and they haven't been as comfortable as these shoes."

It does not look like a huge work boot or have steel toe.  It looks like a black athletic shoe. I need a shoe I can remove foot liner so I can insert my orthotic inside. This can’t be done on ever shoe that sketcher makes and it is one reason I love this particular shoe.. If you can’t take the original liner of a shoe out the orthotic then needs to be placed on top of whatever is already in the shoe and then your heel is slipping out because your whole foot is too high inside the shoe. If you have leg and hip pain from your job ...standing or walking on hard surface ....this is the shoe to try. Buy some Power Step orthodics here on Amazon....insert in this shoe. You will feel the difference. The upper is also leather which is a must if you don’t want smelly feet or wearing vinyl shoe.

Huge and stylish at the same time. I just started a waitressing job and I'm up there in years! My back and feet and legs have been killing me. I read the reviews that these will help and they did!! My younger colleagues are running around in the more slender lower Sketchers and I'm smiling and not saying a word. In terms of whether these have support or not is a debate in the reviews. I will clarify since I used to sell shoes. I am someone with normal arches, so I don't need an orthopedic insert as very high arched people do. However no support at all kills my feet. These have great support for someone as I that doesn't actually need an orthopedic arch support. The plus is that you can put your own orthopedic in if you need. They are great support for me.I love them. They instantly relieve the stress on your back and knees and bounce your steps for a grueling work day!!"

My experience is not normal. That being said - These are very comfortable shoes.  They took a bit of getting used to, of course, but it was a very short transition period.  They worked very well with my special made orthotics, and helped to take some of the pressure off of my bad foot.  These shoes did not, however, completely alleviate my issues, but they were sufficient enough for me to endure the retail environment that I was in (not permitted to sit). I would definitely recommend these shoes for someone in retail, even if you have some foot issues.  They will take the edge off whatever pain you're dealing with."

None.  Zilch. The inside is absolutely flat. Somebody answered a question about arch support and said they did give support.  They do not.

Local stores don't carry the wide width (must have for me), so I never have owned a pair.  But after reading all the reviews and trying to find the right size, color (needed black for work) and comfort, decided to give them a try.  They fit perfectly, even with my orthotic inserts installed.  I laced them up tight the first day to try to avoid that falling off the feet feeling, so the only discomfort was from too tight tops the first day.  My heels, arches and toes were quite pleased.  I loosend them up the next day, and wow, they felt amazingly comfortable.  Wore them all day at work both days, and they felt like they had been broken in for years.  I have had them for about 2 weeks now, and do a lot of walking indoors and out, no problems with slippage, still just as comfortable, and appear to be weaing up well to all my walking.

I have been searching for a decent work shoe for over a month. I tried several other brands but this is my first Skecher. They fit PERFECTLY right out of the box. I believe that it may be due to the lacing. For years I was a 6M. Now with the issues on my left foot, DPM suggested shoes w/wider toe box. I ordered these in 6.5 wide. The wide width fits very well and is not sloppy. No slip on the heel. The top of this shoe is not tight fitting & doesn't dig into the top of my foot. They are well made & look professional. The arch is very good but I still took out the insoles that came with them inserted my own orthotics. As soon as I put them on, I knew they were going to work out. There is no seam by the little toe on each side of the toe box so no toe rubs. They are nice looking & will be perfect for my new job in the cafeteria. I'm not hard on shoes so hope they will last the entire year. Still, I like them enough that I plan to order at least 1 more pair back-ups. Very fair price for a shoe that really fits. Trust these for your feet! Thank you Skechers!"
Skechers,for Work Women's Soft Stride-Softie Lace-Up,B0007TLSE6,R196Z1K1AHL8ZS,"March 15, 2018",5,Great support and comfort,"Best shoe ever!  Because I wear a thick sock with these shoes, I ordered a 10 extra wide, instead of a 10 wide.  So the shoes fit very comfortably.  They have a great grid on the sole and do not slide or slip in wet or slippery conditions.  Also, the sole is very thick and sturdy, preventing any sort of harsh  shock to the spine.  This is really why I love them: striking the ground with the heel that ""gives"" a little and then pushing forward is so comfortable.  This is so great for the back.  And the support is so good that I have no metatarsal pain in the foot.  There are no seams that cut into the foot either.  I have worn them in rain and snow and gotten no leakage.  I did put an orthotic in and had plenty of room in the toe box.  Overall, this is the best shoe I have had, and I have tried many, many brands.  I have herniated disks and a knee replacement and one hip replacement - these shoes help me walk comfortably."

After the first 9 hour shift my feet were a little sore but not too bad.  Five hours into the second shift my feet were killing me.  One of the shoes hit my ankle bone in such a way that it caused the area to swell.  Worst shoes I ever had!!!
Skechers,for Work Women's Soft Stride-Softie Lace-Up,B0007TLSE6,RF9EY4S3FBW1R,"October 19, 2015",3,Okay Shoes!!,"The shoes are good for what my daughter does.  She works in the dairy department at Walmart and my main reason for buying these was for the non-skid bottoms, they were tie up and they were black.  I purchased this exact pair for her around November for Christmas last year.  She did not start wearing them until after Christmas.  By around June or July, they started to start falling apart.  By the time I purchased another pair hers were practically totally off of her feet.  We just bought these again because she needed a new pair.  We knew these would fit & would last a few months, at least.  Skechers needs to improve how they make these shoes so that they last a lot longer than just a few months.  I, myself, will only buy them again for my daughter, if we are in a rush again, but given enough time, we will probably try a different shoe...Unless these shoes say they are new & improved...and they really are!!!"
Skechers,for Work Women's Soft Stride-Softie Lace-Up,B0007TLSE6,R272FIEL1QAPP1,"October 30, 2018",5,No regrets.,"My arthric feet, knees & hips love these shoes. They are very heavy, if thats a problem for you. They are great for absorbing shock. Heavy shoes don’t bother me, unless I am already experiencing fatigue, then, I may choose a lighter weight athletic shoe instead of these. I think i could easily add a shoe insert, but can live without it it, when wearing heavy wool socks. I have wide feet, and depending upon style, select 8 1/2 to 9 in size. These were 8 1/2. Per other reviews, they fit as expected. Per my experience with athletic shoes i’ve purchase in various stores, I would say they are larger or wider than what i have experienced, but that’s what I wanted. My feet swell sometimes, but I only select 9s when the 8 1/2 are too narrow, so these are perfect for what I wanted. They are sharp/neat looking too, given the type of shoe."
Skechers,for Work Women's Soft Stride-Softie Lace-Up,B0007TLSE6,R270JYQ2WD1E43,"July 3, 2017",4,"So far, so good","Wear these shoes five days a week, 10 hrs a day. Replaced the thin, semi-hard insoles with squishy ones, and absolutely no foot pain. Fit well for me, but three complaints: 1. Included shoelaces are too short. An extra 6"" would have been perfect. 2. The back of the shoe seems a bit short, so my foot slides in and out, though infrequently. 3. The height of the interior is pretty short, so if you have tall feet, it might be uncomfortably snug, especially with thicker insoles."

REALLY reviewed other brands, as well as this brand. Figured with high ratings, I'd spend a little more & get comfort. Completely disappointed! Can't WAIT to get out of these shoes before end of shift! Even have Super Feet inserts!! Perhaps I'll try on my next pair at an actual store. 7/7/18 Basically?? I've paid over  $60 for a pair of ""quality shoes"" to give me pain & corns!! Went back to my old pair, to find relief!"

The first day I wore them they felt very comfortable. The size is true, the width is perfect.  But after 3 days the inside totally broke down and my feet started to HURT badly.  After a week I am tossing them.  I hope my feet recover soon.  These are a complete waste of money."

These are fantastic if you are working on your feet all day and need a good shoe to keep your feet comfortable.  I wore them on concrete floors all day long and although my feet were a little tired feeling, it was SO MUCH BETTER than any other shoe I have worn.  I only wish they made the shoe a bit more stylish, black shoes seem like they are orthopedic and are somewhat sterile.  But honestly as I tell everyone, I care much more about comfort than fashion.  I'd rather have happy feet than have someone complement me on how pretty my shoes are.  To each their own, but if you care about comfort I truly recommend this shoe!"

I walked all through Disneyland with them and  they were fine.  The only complaint I have is the laces they come with suck.  They are too short, and were constantly coming undone.  I had to replace them."
Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0-go Forward Sneaker,B07H61JGMS,R1RFQCSF3DP39S,"January 17, 2020",3,Horrible Laces,"Not sure if these are a bit big or if my other Sketcher's are a bit small. But compared to the ones I have, these feel about a half size too big. The laces are HORRENDOUS. Too short, too slippery and feel like gift wrap ribbon. Won't stay tied. Not a lot of support. My other Sketcher's Memory Foam shoes were more comfortable.  (But they do not make that style anymore.) If I had payed the full price of $60, I would have returned, but these were $27-ish on here."
Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0-go Forward Sneaker,B07H61JGMS,R16JBXPA8X61BU,"January 29, 2020",3,Inadequate padding throughout the shoe,"I loved the material and the looks of the shoe, however; after putting them on and taking a few steps, I quickly noted that the high-quality microfoam padding thinned out and could not even be felt under the ball of the foot.  The only way I could wear these would be by adding foam inserts which would not fit as the toe box was on the small side."
Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0-go Forward Sneaker,B07H61JGMS,R2WG6LRRC2ZZI9,"December 26, 2019",5,Sleek not bulky,"I ordered my usual 6.5 and they fit well. I love wearing athletic leisure outfits, but I also workout, so I’m always looking for functional shoes that are also stylish. What I love about these is they aren’t bulky. My feet look slim in them, rather than wide and clunky. Very comfortable. I’ll most likely offer more."
Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0-go Forward Sneaker,B07H61JGMS,R3CDZ8RP9004IU,"January 27, 2020",5,Very light and comfortable,I am usually a size 6-6.5 so I ordered a size 6.5 (light green) and a size 7 (black) and 7 fit perfectly. I picked the 6.5 ($20) and the 7 ($25) black because they were the cheapest. The size 6.5 is very tight on my feet so I returned it. I was really tired one day after work with heavy boots but needed to go out and I changed to these shoes and I was very impressed - I didn’t feel tired with these. Go try it!
Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0-go Forward Sneaker,B07H61JGMS,ROYWU3C9FX2KU,"February 18, 2020",5,I'm very satisfied,"Received this pair today, and already wore them without socks. Very comfy indeed. Before writing this review I tried them on with socks and had to loosen up the laces a bit to fit them on, but I expect they will stretch a bit with use. Having said this, they don't pinch at all, and look expensive. A while ago I had to ditch a pair of store-bought Nikes worth 170 something, white with black trimmings, because I had the bright idea to put them in the dryer and one of them got caught and was completely deformed. And they never were too comfortable, after a while they started pinching across the width in the bunion area. And I had trouble putting them on with socks, had opted to remove the insoles to create more space. Which was not ideal. So this pair of Skechers are AOK, good value for the price, and I hope I will be wearing for a long time and intend to get them in additional colors, like white and some other combination."

Skechers,Women's Microburst 2.0-Best Ever Sneaker,B07P8WPSJL,RIO0U49O8XIAK,"November 3, 2019",5,Perfect!,"1. Take shoes out of box.  Oooh and ahh over how cute they are. 2. Put shoes on.  More ooh-ing and ahh-ing because they are so comfortable and cute (even on). 3. Pretty much forget to take them off because they feel like house slippers...with a bit more support. Note:  I ordered these in my regular shoe size of 8.5, but returned them for size 8, which fit perfectly.  I would suggest you order your shoe size and one half size down and return the ones that don't fit (cuz Amazon makes returns so easy, anyway).  That way, you won't be disappointed that you have to wait a couple of days for the new pair (or, heaven forbid, they don't have your size which would be a tragedy). I might have to order another color.  The beauty of Skechers is that they are totally machine washable.  Love that feature!  Also, I have some serious bunions and flat feet and pronation, so I usually buy the expensive orthotic shoes, but Skechers seem to address all those issues (especially the bunions--no pain at all) fairly well."
Skechers,Women's Microburst 2.0-Best Ever Sneaker,B07P8WPSJL,R20RVZ709WUHJ3,"February 15, 2020",5,It's All True,"I saw these shoes on QVC and decided to compare their price to Amazon.  I figure I saved in the neighborhood of $10 if you add in QVC's shipping charges.  QVC also had some bright colors that Amazon didn't.  But let me tell you about the comfort.  They fit like a glove right out of the box.  I like that they don't come up too high on my foot or too low; makes me feel like Goldilocks - just right!  I can wiggle my toes, yet they're not too large.  I like shoes I can put on hands-free.  These will fill the bill and probably become my go-to shoes this summer.  If I had to criticize them at all, I'd say they look a bit like old-lady shoes.  But guess what!  I'm an old lady.  P.S:  I got the khaki."

The earlier shoes I bought fit great, no problem.  The last 2 pairs, including this pair, run bigger.  I wear a 9 but these are too loose.  I will not return these.  Will try an insert to remedy the situation.  Skechers.....why can’t you standardize the sizes?  Great, comfortable shoes, still my favorite but please work on a solution to the sizing."

Skechers,for Work Women's Workshire Peril Steel Toe Boot,B00NXZ5EEG,R23Y1KBV2OX6WI,"June 17, 2018",5,FOR WOMEN LOOKING FOR A GOOD WORK BOOT.,"I dont typically write reviews but I want to help some sisters out. I had a hell of a time trying to find decent work boots and all the reviews I read on every boot I looked at were NOT helpful. So hopefully this one will be. I am a tile installer, I'm on my knees every day and put SO much wear and tear on shoes. After my last boots were pretty gross I looked high and low for a new pair and came across these puppy's. So here's my breakdown of these boots. I'm typically a 7.5 for flats and an 8 for heels. I ordered a 7.5 and they were roomier than I wanted but they still fit fine. I was use to a tighter boot but after getting use to it and some cheap insoles (just to life my foot up a bit) they were totally great. THERE WAS LITERALLY NO BREAK IN!!! from day one these boots were SO comfy. Omg! The padding in the boot is like a little pillow. I never had ONE blister or sore feet!!! I was seriously thrilled. Even with being roomy and the steal toe they are seriously comfy boots. I've had them since last September. They still look great and have held together so well! The leather isn't even close to exposing the steal, and all the seams are solid. Theres extra leather where you bend at the toe and the sole is nice and thick. It has been really hard for me to find a true womans work boot but I'm sold on these for life. I will absolutely buy them again. They are comfy and sturdy and I couldn't ask for anything else....oh and they're also kind of cute in an ass kicking way."
Skechers,for Work Women's Workshire Peril Steel Toe Boot,B00NXZ5EEG,R3AJ9OXMTXWACD,"May 15, 2015",5,Best boots I've ever gotten!,"I bought a pair of these at a local shoe depot and got the 6.5. The ended up being too big and my feet slammed into that steel toe. I tried exchanging them for a 6 but couldn't find a pair but loved these boots so much that I ordered them here. The leather is a little stiff the first few minutes after putting them on but after that they are amazing! The memory foam makes a 12 hour shift a breeze. They have so far stood up to anything a barista can throw at them and then some. I slipped in a creek and dunked a whole foot, socks were still dry. I would absolutely recommend these to any hiker, employee, friend and strangers!"
Skechers,for Work Women's Workshire Peril Steel Toe Boot,B00NXZ5EEG,RJ8XARU0UCENN,"June 11, 2018",5,"Very comfortable right out of the box, great quality and construction - excellent price!","Right out of the box, super comfy, nice foot-bed, flexible yet sturdy boot. I ordered a size 8, and I wear a 7.5 in an Asics Gel Nimbus and 7 to 7.5 in other open toe shoes/heels/sandals/flip-flops, but for work boots, I wanted a little more wiggle room for the toes, especially if I'm going to want, or need, to wear thicker socks. A few people have commented on the steel toes ""cutting"" into their toes when they kneel down, ie bending the toe bed, which yes, with certain boots, you can feel the metal in one way or another (some worse than others). The way to kneel in steel-toe boots is to NOT bend your toes as if you're in a plain sneaker, and instead, keep your foot/toes straight and put the toe of the boot right on the ground... hence why you see so many steel-toe boots with the fronts all dinged/scuffed/scratched up... it's like a steel-toe ballet slipper... they stand ON the toe, they don't bend... get it? Overall, very happy with the quality and construction, especially for the price - and I fully expect my feet to stay relatively safe and comfortable in these, as they get scuffed up as we tackle the overhaul of our driveway, yard, etc, working around our house and all the other projects on the list."

The boots are light weight, fit true to size, but the leather is stiff and will take some time to break in, after a few days my skin had some blistering start around the ankles so I adjusted my socks to alleviate that until the boots are better broke in.  The quality is good and they seem well made to last a long time.  Don't buy them just for the memory foam, there is no arch support and I had to put insoles in them; I have high arches.  After the first few hours wearing them at work my feet hurt, they are hard on the bottom and insoles are a must, the memory foam does nothing, that's why they only get 4 stars instead of 5.  They show scuff marks easily or maybe that's just from working in a warehouse, the pictures attached show a pic of when I first got them and then pics with scuff marks from after a week of working in them.

And by the end of the day, my feet are killing me. Through to about midday through my shift I’m not doing too bad, but I can’t wait to take them off when I get home. I don’t think that the memory foam is thick enough. When standing or walking, you can feel your feet sink into the footbed, but then it’s like you are standing on flat concrete. If the memory foam was thicker, I think that these would be much better and feel better. It just feels like there is no cushion on it at all after you take steps or are standing. I would like to try them again if they are ever reproduced with thicker memory foam. But for now, they were pretty much a bust for me."

All of my other slip resistant shoes have a tighter/smaller waffle patterned bottom. But I really do like the looks and comfort of them which is why I gave a 5 star rating.  As far as the boot being a bit larger than expected, I just double my socks and/or place additional inserts. I just have to be a bit more mindful especially when working on greasy floors. They do however keep your feet dry. Maybe this is what they are referring to in their description...  slip resistant against spilling grease and water on the top and sides of the shoe.

At first they felt ok, but then after a day of wearing them they felt too big. But the inside of the shoe is SO comfy and squishy like memory foam. But they felt too loose all over (and I have WIDE FEET!!) so I opted to return the shoes and order a 7.5. Then.... with the 7.5 I could feel the steel toe ridge along the top of my foot, so uncomfortable! Even though they were the perfect size... I don't know if the particular shoe I got was defective or what... But I was so over the whole situation that I just returned them and bought Timberland pros for women. Long story short.. I hope people were able to find and/or receive ones that fit and weren't defective because they truly are great for wide feet and the inner part of the shoe is like walking on marshmallows.

After doing a thorough search while trying to educate myself a little, I kept going back to these and was hoping they'd simply feel a little better to her than the ones she had.  I wish I had a video to share of the way she behaved after putting them on and walking around.  She was astounded over the comfort and ease of movement.  To assure her they were not as expensive as she thought, I finally told her how much the gift cost.  That was another pleasant surprise.

First of all I read a bunch of the negative reviews of this product, then skipped up to the positive reviews. With all the different sized and shaped feet in the world, I think it is sheer luck if you can find shoes online that actually fit perfectly. Some reviewers who loved these shoes had wide feet (as I have) so I decided to take a chance and order them. I tried them on with a good pair of smart wool socks. At first they felt strange because of the steel toe and your foot cannot bend at the toes as you walk, and I worried I would not get used to that, so I just walked around the house for about 15  minutes and then became convinced that these are comfortable. They also look nice. I will only be using these for chainsawing periodically, so if I find any problems with them once I am out in the woods at work,  I will update my review."

These are a relaxed fit, so I don't experience the tightness around the ankles at all. They are also a sleeker design, so they don't look like logs. The gel insert makes them comfortable to walk in, but only for a few hours. I have long days in these shoes, and towards the end (like the 7-8 hour mark), my feet start to hurt. I do wish they had a side zipper closure for easy take on and take off. I am training in the fire service, and we are required to take off our shoes in a matter of seconds to get our gear on. These shoes make that difficult if I've tied the laces too tight. I am normally a size 6.5 or 7 in women's shoes, and I ordered a 7 in these. The fit is perfect."

I use them mostly for digging and outdoor work that requires heavy lifting, as they support my high arches. Because digging in my area requires pre-soaking the ground with water, they get wet regularly yet still hold up with little to no care.

It is an amazing work boot and the steel toe is none like any other, especially for a women's shoe from SKETCHERS of all places!  It keeps insulation pretty well for those cold days and isn't too humid on hotter days. BUT I have been working at UPS, centering my time in a factory/warehouse setting. Although the comfort of these shoes is incredible, it does not last very long. I am about to purchase my third pair of boots because of the wear and tear I have had on the inside of the shoe. The most common places for wear and tear are the heels, which result in plastic chipping off the inside, and the memory foam literally dissipating. Although this can be annoying, I am still loyal and committed enough to the comfort and usefulness of this shoe to buy a third pair!

Apaprently, these are a ""Relaxed Fit"" but currently on Amazon, neither the the product name or description mentions ""relaxed fit"" at all. I had no idea until I opened the box and I got the shoe, and then came back to the site to investigate. Relaxed fit is odd... it's not exactly a wide, but there is a ton of room in the toe box, which would probably be great if you have bunions. There's also a lot of room around the heel, which means that even though they are not too long for my foot, they slide up and down with every step. Obviously, they have to go back.

I stopped wearing them since and the blisters have gone away and my ankles no longer bother me. I'm very upset by this as I have had shoes from Skechers that lasted me years.

I am a barista and customer service rep and stand on a concrete floor all day. I have mild bunions and feet that swell. I need a comfortable and forgiving shoe to save my joints. The Sport Women's Empire ( SN 12414) looks the same for half the price, but it is smaller, narrower and heavier despite the ""relaxed fit"" label. The toe box is tapered more sharply and is much narrower, and squeezes. The memory foam insole has a higher arch, is more firm, and does not spread across the entire bottom of the shoe, leaving gaps and bumpy seams where there should be seamless insole. The back of the heel upper is less padded and slips more while walking. If you have a long narrow foot with a moderate arch, it's probably a decent shoe for the price. But for someone with low arches who needs a roomier toe box and is on her feet all day, prepare to shell out for the better made shoe."

Casual walking around for short periods of time, sure, but I wouldn't take these out to a theme park or heavy duty walking or standing. - I have a wide toe box and it really hurt until the material stretched out - They started out just right in terms of fit and now they are getting comically loose and my foot slides around on the inside constantly. Like I stated, for the price for a sneaker like this - sure it's okay.  I put these on to run quick errands or taking my kids to the park/playground, but that's about it."

They're loose like a slipper. I put an innersole in them.  I can't wear them sockless because the inside against the top of the foot has a very rough and scratchy surface.  If I had tried them on in a store, I wouldn't have bought them. I wore them for a day before I realized they weren't what I expected, so I can't return them. First Skechers that I don't care for.

It's a fashion sneaker.","I kind of feel like I should have known better. These have their good points: they're light, they look nice, no ties to mess with, the knit body of the shoe fits pretty well even on my wide foot. On the should-have-known-side: these have a weak, cushioned insole, which is initially cozy. There is ZERO SUPPORT. No arch, no heel, nada baby. The cushion starts to flatten almost immediately. At that point, the light, thin sole becomes a liability, and these really hurt to walk in. I ended up replacing the soggy cushions with expensive insoles, which is pretty workable. I should have just spent more on a better shoe."

I wanted a shoe that was comfortable to walk a lot in, but also cute and could go with dressier shirts and this shoe fits the bill. I have very narrow feet so they are a little loose on me, but would probably be OK for someone with normal or wider feet. They stretch out some as you wear them and get kind of roomy in the toe area, but if a light sock is worn, this probably wouldn't be an issue. I'm in love with these shoes...so stylish. I've gotten a lot of compliments on them."

Day 1 they fit great and felt like I was walking on pillows.  After wearing them on the airplane, my feet and ankles swelled (never happened before), which made the shoes feel tight.  The swelling did not come down until I got home and got out of these shoes.  By the end of the trip my feet were sore and desperately longing for more arch support. These might still be good shoes for light walking while running errands or walking the dog, but I wouldn’t recommend them if you plan on walking for long trips."
Skechers,Sport Women's Breathe Easy Fortune Fashion Sneaker,B01HT8YEO8,RQ9F2Z20327HJ,"June 8, 2017",5,Some of the Best Shoes I Have Ever Purchased,"I purchased this pair of Fortune Navy Knit sneakers after finally wearing out a pair of the Fortune Charcoal Knit sneakers that I bought in-store 8 months ago. I work in an IT support position that requires *a lot* walking and movement, and these shoes allow me to keep going for long periods of time without getting sore legs or feet. The memory foam insoles are a godsend when you're up on your feet all day. Fashion-wise, one of the things I love about Skechers is that they offer a lot of colors and styles that work well in both business and casual settings. Both of the colors mentioned above and in this particular style go really well with dark jeans and nice blouses. These shoes do stretch a little bit with wear but it hasn't caused any issues for me. I wear a size 9, and the pair I purchased from Amazon fit as expected. On a side note: I have always struggled with sneakers, even highly recommended ones, because the soles often have thick heels. The heels on the Fortune Knit style are only 1/2 inch thick so I am able to walk in a way that is more comfortable and truer to my natural gait. It's hard to explain, but it's as close to feeling like walking around barefoot as I've ever come in sneakers. If you try these and love them, take note of the design on the sole of the shoe. Skechers makes a number of styles with the same sole, and I have yet to be disappointed with the ones I have tried."
Skechers,Sport Women's Breathe Easy Fortune Fashion Sneaker,B01HT8YEO8,RFVEZ0W48TJV3,"December 22, 2019",1,Cute but NO,"I have worn these shoes for nearly a year as my long distance travel shoe. I have therefore worn them for a full 24 hours on long flights. I have also worn them for long mall shopping trips. I have never used them for exercise. Pros: They are cute...look very nice on my foot. The colour is good. Mine is blue and looks incredible with jeans. They have kept their structural integrity - no tears, no parts lost. They are lightweight. They are  wonderful for pesky airport security procedures because you can walk through the machines and if they insist that you remove the shoe, they are very easy to remove and to wear. Cons: They are uncomfortable! I have to wear visible socks because the shoe hurts the back of my heel - I think it is called Achilles bursitis. I need socks otherwise I get actual injuries. They are weirdly bouncy to the point where they are uncomfortable and there is also a way in which it pronates my foot which is naturally supinated (outward leaning). It is pretty much the other extreme of how my foot is made and it really hurts after an hour or so of walking or standing. The mall trips are agony due to the amount of time spent on my feet. Finally, the shoe sole of a bit of a hard rubber that is almost plastic and is slippery. For these reasons, this shoe is uncomfortable and dangerous."

They didn't arrive as quickly as promised, so I phoned Amazon and they sent me a rush replacement pair. They are SO comfortable, and look good with a skirt or dress. I now wear them constantly. My feet are narrow and hard to fit with a bunion, but these shoes are perfect. I can skrinch up the elastic laces to make them narrowish, and the front expands nicely around the bunion. I got compliments on them overseas too. Thanks to Amazon for their superior service getting me the shoes in time for my trip. (The first pair arrived while I was on vacation, and I returned them.)  They walked for miles and miles without a blister. Yay!"

I sort of held my breath when buying these because slip ons often are too big, but these are just right! I use them to walk on the treadmill and after using for about a week, they are fine and NO BLISTERS or slipping up and down on my heels (using socks)! They have memory fiam inside them as well so they are very comfortable. (The Goga Maxx insoles are comfy for casual walking but the memory foam is better.)

They are very comfortable and easy to wear, and I like the style.  The soles and outside hold up really well, and I really wore the heck out of my first pair.  My only complaint is about the insoles - they don't hold up as well as the rest of the shoe.  Mine became loose and messy and eventually tore, and inserting my own insoles messed with the fit of the shoe.  So even though my first pair still looked good on the outside, I bought the second pair because of the torn up inside. But I like them enough that I'd probably still buy a third pair if I had to.  :)"
Skechers,Sport Women's Breathe Easy Fortune Fashion Sneaker,B01HT8YEO8,R2377RFUCSFQ7,"November 11, 2018",4,Comfortable but a little slippy,"I bought these so I would have low profile, less obvious walking shoes for a vacation in Europe. They slide on easily, and the memory gel on top of my orthotics keeps them comfortable for several hours a day. However, I did notice immediately that they did nothing to prevent me from slipping on wet sidewalks or pavement. Because I was going to Ireland and Scotland, I was a little panicked. Before we left, I rubbed them around on my cement patio, and then rubbed the bottoms some more with sandpaper. I had pretty good luck with that and experienced no more slips, but I was careful just in case. So, I would recommend these for dry climates, but take precautions and be aware of your step in wet and muddy areas. I would definitely not wear these in icy or snow conditions as the let in quite a lot of moisture (or air alternatively) and will absolutely go sliding right across that ice."

If they used leather on this than it is leather that is just so thin it is pasted on top of some kind of cardboard or so it feels. They're lightweight and comfortable within about 2 or 3 days when the fits your foot perfect but it's not the leather like they used to make them and that makes me sad. I wish I was able to find the black cabs leather sketchers I had in black again but unfortunately they have so many different designs now finding them is near to impossible so I settled for the ones I purchased. The quality is about 60 to 70% of the quality the ones they used to make our. I think they weren't worth the price I paid for them but they are comfortable so I think fell due. But I think this review is important because if you like me are looking for something similar to what you had before I assure you the quality is not what it used to be whether it's there using cheaper ingredients to keep the price down I don't know but it's not the same shoes I had come to love They do the job they are comfortable but be assured the quality again is nowhere near what it used to be and it's not the sellers fault! I received them fast and in a really great Box! It's just not what I was expecting and that's my fault

I originally stated that I didn't like the heel, but I have been wearing these shoes for a few months now, and they are my favorite shoes.  When you are used to the old bottoms, these take about a week to get used to, but no pain involved, just a different feel.  I have bone spurs in my knees, so I was concerned.  I have had no issues so far.  They are very comfy, true to size and they don't hurt any part of me at all.

Also, I broke a bone in that same foot a few years back, and the foot remains a bit swollen. As I expected, the shoes started off a little tight on my bad foot; however, they have now conformed to fit my feet like a comfy glove. They are well cushioned and I could walk in them all day. I bought the light gray ones this time, but I will soon be replacing my previous pair of black ones. I didn't realize how stretched out and worn down my black ones were, but they have served me well as my primary footwear for a few years now. Can't say enough good things about these shoes!"

This last pair I purchased from Amazon and exactly one month after purchase I just noticed that there the fabric is separating from the back of the heel.

Update: I reordered and received 2 9.5s, but they were unfortunately too small. Smaller than the previous 9.5s I’ve tried on. They too will have to go back. Unfortunately, I think it’s possible, due to the nature of the style and the tucked toe, it allows for more irregularities than your normal shoe.

I am on my feet most of the day and my regular dress flats were killing my feet. I have a wide foot, so I was hoping these would work for me. I ordered a 7 C/D which is supposed to be wide width, but they are not. The box says ""wide fit"" and it's not the same thing. They are more narrow than a traditional wide width shoe with a more narrow sole. As I've worn them they have widened a little, but I still think they would have fit better if they were a true wide width. I also do not think they offer very much support. They didn't kill my feel, but my feet are definitely tired and sore by the end of the day. The cushion insole didn't do anything special for me. As many other reviewers have stated, the sole on these shoes do not have traction and are quite slippery. I am on carpet all day at work, so I am not super concerned about them in that environment. But on my wood floors are home, etc they slide very easily. I will continue to wear these because they are better than dress flats but will keep looking for something more comfortable and better fitting."
Skechers,BOBS Women's Bobs Plush-Peace & Love,B07NDM4SLK,R2IY8XM13SJ1YL,"January 21, 2017",5,Just what I needed.,"These are my favorite shoes now and I have bought/received several other pairs to switch between. I have not owned or worn TOMS so I can't make the comparison there for those who are curious; but from other reviews it sounds like they are on par or often more comfortable. I personally don't like to wear shoes all that often unless I'm going for a run or riding my bike. The fit at first seems terrible and I almost considered sending them back. However after a week or two of wear they break in and are incredible. I will admit it's hard to get past that first fitment. I really thought I'd bought the ""wrong"" pair of shoes and would be stuck with them like others in the past. I wear a 7.5-8 and got the 7.5 which just felt ""big"" at first. But stick with it -- you won't regret it. They just need time to fit you. I have washed them once already on the delicate cycle. They survived! Let them air dry -- and they smelled much better. If you do wear them everyday get a couple pairs to alternate, else they will get pretty stinky quickly. For me they are a great compromise for wearing ""shoes"" when I really don't want to. :)"

After finding how comfortable they are, I looked for a second pair, but color choices were minimal.  So of course I went to Amazon and found a wider selection and better price.  This shoe is extremely comfortable, perfect for all-day errands, traveling, and being active on your feet.  The memory foam provides that extra needed comfort in a flat shoe.  I prefer this over my pair of Toms."

I wore these shoes all day today and they were so comfortable!! more cushion than the toms!! the memory foam on the bottom is a firm cushion and quite nice to walk in.

I originally got a tan pair from a different store thinking they were Tom's. (Similar label style and colors) My obtuse self thought they were Tom's for over a month until I went to order this pair in the dark blue and finally realized they are called Bob's. After actually trying on a true pair of Tom's, I quickly came to the conclusion that my pathetic paws preferred the Bob's brand. I know Tom's are built to last but they were just too hard on my feet, and that is comming from someone who prefers to be barefoot. After a full month of almost daily use the tan pair still look new except for the random blue stain I got on one of them so I think they are at the very least decent quality. I am a teacher and rarely get to sit during the day and usually have sore feet at the end of the day, but not in these shoes! My goal is to have like 5 different colors of these Bob's for work and because they are so reasonably priced that is going to be a reality very quickly. If these shoes last about a year it will totally be worth the price for the level of comfort I get from them. I would bite the bullet and try these for sure."

Once I was convinced to buy a pair, I realized that they were so much more comfortable than Toms due to the memory foam. I love these shoes because they kept you in a rather natural posture when you stand or walk, but they protect your feet like they're supposed to, they're stylish, and they are so comfortable. I think I should've ordered a 7.5, but I ordered the 8, and they're just a little big. I'm gonna keep them anyways, but now I know for next time to get a size smaller, because I know that these shoes are made out of canvas. Canvas stretches. If you get yours and they feel tight around your toes, just know that they will stretch and fit differently in the matter of about a week or two, depending on how often you walk with them. These was a good price. I used to buy them from Sketchers cause I had a family discount or something. (my sister worked there) Now that I don't get that discount, I stopped buying them. I switched to Sketcher Go Runs as my main shoes because I was standing in one spot all day, and Bobs/Toms hurt. Now, I move a lot. I do a lot of walking, and I realized that I needed to go back to flat shoes for that. That's why I came to Amazon. The price was way better, and I got them without having to go to the store."

Since these were still Skechers I had high expectations, expectations that have been met from wearing them for a couple of weeks.  First off, they look really nice so I can wear them to work, which is absolutely imperative for me; secondly, they're comfy enough for me to wear while running errands and I find not many shoes can fit that need for me, since I have both flat feet and plantar fasciitis, meaning I'm a difficult customer when it comes to shoes.  They also don't take but a few seconds for me to put on, which I love because I always leave putting on shoes for the final thing I do before going out.

They did not. I tried Bobs because I have ordered Sketchers in the past and like the support and range of wideness and style. I am a size 10W, and had difficulty before my weight loss finding a true wide. My feet are still considered wide so I opted for the wide size BOBs. I took them out of the box and they fit perfectly! I was surprised and thrilled to find the memory foam would provide more than a flat rubber sole like its counterpart. Around the toes and top of the foot, the shoes fit like a hug. Around the heel, theres a bit of space which likely means they are a bit longer than other 10s. No matter, I will insert heel insoles for further support. I like the look of these shoes and they are practical as well as fashionable. Gym/tennis/athletic shoes can be bulky and hot. These shoes are lighter and can be worn to more places. I recommend!

I usually am a 9-9.5, and buy 9.5 in the regular size and they fit snug, but with the wides, I almost have too much room length-wise and width-wise. The fit of the shoe completely changes when it is the right width for your foot. That said, I kept them because they are really comfy and I like to wear socks in them anyway.

I have been looking for a pair of cute comfortable flats to wear to work that wouldn't hurt/worsen my bunion. These shoes are light and comfortable, I live and work downtown Chicago - meaning TONS of walking, and I was amazed to at no blisters and no bunion pain! I also have wider feet so these shoes are stretchy and soft enough that they form to your foot without squeezing anything too tight. I would usually wear a 5.5, but I went to the store and tried on both the 5.5 and 6, but decided to go with a 6 to give extra room for my toes to not be pinched. Very happy with these shoes and will definitely be ordering more!"

I also have wide feet and wanted to make sure the pointed toe didn't squish my feet. I don't mean to sound shoe-ist or anything, but I never thought I'd own a pair of sketchers. Generally, their sneakers look like 2001 just threw up all over them. But these...these feel like hugs for my feet. I've already ordered my next pair in navy (going to keep with the size 9, but for people with slimmer feet, you could probably stick with your true size). I work in a corporate setting and a lot of days don't feel like wearing heels. These are just the ticket. So, yea, I own a pair of sketchers (2 pairs soon, mon dieu). There's no logo though. Just basic comfy flats with a moderate amount of scalloping for that classy vibe. To me, they sort of remind me of those Herve Leger bandaid dresses, but for your feet, nice stretch. Love em. Price point is right."

I love the idea of Rothy's but can't afford them. These shoes are Skechers' answer to Rothy's so I took the plunge. These fit true to size and don't rub. I didn't get a single raw spot or blister. Narrow feet might drown, though, so keep that in mind. These took a couple of weeks to get stinky and I threw them into the wash with great results. They came out looking like new. Fast forward to the second wash: the insole fell to pieces and one of the shoes now has pilled fabric. They're still wearable, but even with intact insoles you could feel every bit of the ground under your feet.  Now that the insole is chewed up, it's very uncomfortable to walk on anything other than flat ground. I'll continue to wear these, but I won't be replacing them. If anything, they've convinced me to save money for Rothy's. Away least those you can buy new insoles for when needed. I'm glad I bought these Skechers, but I honestly don't know if I'd recommend them."

First Impressions: They're quite comfortable & cute almond toe shaped flats, if a bit conservative looking (e.g. the vamp could be a bit lower). I tend to walk out of the heel of the left shoe from time to time, although they seem to run true to size. The heel area of the left flat seemed a bit compressed during shipping, so perhaps my issue will improve with time. I'll update this review after wearing them for a few days/weeks. On the Sketchers website one of their CS reps mentioned this make/model could be machine washed on the delicate cycle (similar to Rothy's), so I'm looking forward to testing this feature."

I did wear them recently to a funeral/visitation and stood for about 2 hours.  This is the first pair of ballet flats I have worn in several years that got me through that long a time period without major discomfort.  Overall, I am very pleased but the 4 star rating is because they tend to slip off my heel."

The knit material doesn't rub any blisters. They also have a nice memory foam sole. They still look very stylish though. Warning: I have these exact shoes in navy that I bought at a shoe store. I had to buy different sizes in the different colors. In the navy it took an 8.5, but the black I had to return for an 8. There was a very noticeable difference in size between colors. Once you get the right size they are great. I would recommend doing the Amazon Wardrobe and trying on different sizes before purchasing."

They have all fit perfectly!  When I put them on, it feels like a hug on my feet. I have issues finding shoes that fit comfortably across my right foot because of an old break on my big toe and it's created a bunion type shape. These shoes fit so nicely across that joint and creates zero pain by the end of the day. Worth the price!!"

Shoes should be made for walking, including the stylish shoes. I never imagined myself in Sketchers, but these check all the boxes for casual & stylish walking shoes. Good for travel, and great for women whom take public transit or else do a lot of walking during the day. I usually wear a size 9 or 8.5, and ordered a 9 in this shoe. The toe box was a little cramped but the material stretches so this was not a problem by the end of the first day. With a little more foam and a thicker sole they'd be perfect city shoes. Given that they stretch I might try a foam insert. At this price I think they should include a thicker sole, more arch support, and more foam. Though I don't expect them to last long with thin sole, very happy that they are comfortable."

The first time I wore them they were great. I stand and walk all day and my feet were not sore at the end. The second day I wore them they were not as comfortable, but still better than other flats. By the third wear the insole shifted and was coming out and less than an hour in and my feet were killing me. The insole falling apart after two wears is ridiculous."

These are ok, I’m hoping they stretch out once I wear them a few times. Basic black with texture and I like the scallops to add a little feminine detail. Pointy toe which equals less room. I have wide feet, maybe not my best choice. Heel slips around the back, no blisters after 1 use which is a good sign. Comfort soles, I didn’t notice, not flat like a board, but not the normal sketchers cushion I have experienced in the past. I live in tennis shoes and sandals, it’s been years since I tried dress shoes. I think these will be fine."

These came up as an alternative when I was searching for Rothys flats and I am so happy to have found them. The knit material gives the red a little texture that makes them interesting without having a print. The upper fabric is flexible enough for the size 10 regular shoes to fit my 10 wide feet comfortably. Despite feeling a little loose when I tried them on, the shoes stay on my feet well and are easy to walk in. The scallop edging make them feel a little offbeat. Even the insole has a star design printed on it. While there isn't a ton of arch support (not something I look for--most of my shoes are almost entirely flat) the insole has some cushioning making them comfortable for walking around where I work and in the subway for my commute."

I usually wear a size 8 and these fit my foot length wise but because of the looseness of the fabric of the shoe, it stretched and falls off my foot! Plus, the backing is stiff and uncomfortable and rubs the back of my foot badly. When I initially wore these inside, they fit well. When I wore them a day at work, they stretched and started rubbing. Definitely regret buying these. Plus the cushioning isn’t that great. If I stood on my feet a lot, I would be in pain after a while. Super bummed I wasted my money."

I love these!""  I put on a cute outfit to go to work and wanted to wear these to work but as I walked around the house and went up and down the stairs, I noticed the back rubs on my heel a little.  I thought it would not be that big of a deal since the rubbing is not as bad as other flats but I knew if I wore them to work I would be uncomfortable and have my heels scraped and would not be able to return it after all the walking and sweating in them. I have size 11 feet, wide with a bunion and really wanted to love these.  I think they could benefit by having a little cushiony piece on the heel.  Also I would have liked to have this in size 11.5 so it wouldn't look so sock-like or water shoes-like on my feet."

I couldn't pull  the trigger on Rothy's due to price - but  was looking for that type of shoe. Found these at DSW, fell in love and then found them cheaper on Amazon. They  are comfortable, flexible mesh-like material. Sturdy  and thick - I actually wore no shoe  socks with  them with no visibility. Highly recommend."
Skechers,Women's Cleo Bewitch Ballet Flat,B01N2RZ1W6,R32VB38Z39TWWN,"September 3, 2019",4,Nice..... would prefer a lower price than $50..... but nice.,"I’m usually a size 7.5 & I have wide feet, ordered the 8. I usually don’t purchase pointed toe shoe because of the wide feet that I have- the first day of wearing them all the corners of my toes hurt extremely bad. The next few days I tried wearing them and they were fine. The sole/bottom does come apart like another review I read said- makes you feel like the shoe was just thrown together-unless it’s like that so you can switch out the sole, but I don’t see the reason in that if this sole is supposed to be what makes them so comfy why switch it out.... It is a gap where the heel and shoe meet when you put them on (like another review I read said also) The comfort is better than what I was wearing (sandals from target with no comfort soles) so it’s better than what I had but am I walking in clouds? Not necessarily. If these shoes were maybe $25 I wouldn’t mind getting another pair but the price is borderline $50 so it doesn’t help the pockets much. As an overall they are ok and I would rate them 4stars because they are better than what I was getting and the Rothys are about $150. More colors in this style would be nice and a tad bit lower price for Skechers."
Skechers,Women's Cleo Bewitch Ballet Flat,B01N2RZ1W6,R2GTCXQ4KDS3YJ,"July 21, 2017",3,Too small by amost a full size.  I wear 7/7.5 and ordered a 7.5 but I think an 8.5 would have been better,I like the shoe but the size is a full size too small.  I wear a 7 or 7.5 .  I ordered a 7.5 and it was at least 1/2 size too small...I needed an 8.  My toes are at the tip of the shoe and the toes are squeezed.  Because there is give in the shoe I can still wear the shoe.  It's a good shoe if you have bunions...but order one size up.  I wear a 7 or 7.5 and I believe an 8.5 would have served me well.  I think even an 8 would have been tight.  If a shoe is 1/2 size to large you can always use inserts inside the shoe.  If it's too tight you are out of luck .
Skechers,Women's Cleo Bewitch Ballet Flat,B01N2RZ1W6,R2OXRVBLJV2XMO,"January 17, 2019",3,A different shoe experience,"These look nice and I am keeping them for that reason.  They definitely provide a different shoe experience.  They are stretchy and fit quite snug - they crunch the toes on my rather wide feet a bit, but not to the point of being painful.  The heel is a little deep and hits high on my ankle.  This is a little uncomfortable when sitting because they are kind of squeezing my feet.  They also rub a bit when walking, so I wouldn't trust them for the zoo or a museum."

I was able to try these on in the store, so I knew in advance that they run a little short.  I usually wear and 8, but the 8.5 was needed for these... and they're perfect.

The first few days they did dig into my heels and cause blisters, but I chalked that up to me wearing too-thin socks. After that, though, they saved my feet. These are the only shoes I've been able to comfortably stand in for 14+ hour shifts. They come with thick, cushioned insoles and their tie-less design makes them easy to slip on/off. Bonus: they can be sent through a washing machine when you inevitably get something gross on them. 10/10, would recommend to any doctor/nurse/PT/student in need. Don't shell out $100+ for those hideous clogs everybody wears - this will do you just as well."

I have Achilles Tendinitis and Plantar Fasciitis so I'm a little picky. I hate the look of Danskos so I decided to try these. When I first put them on, the memory foam seemed really stiff and I was worried about the lack of arch support. After an hour, the foam had warmed up and contoured to my foot really nicely. After two weeks of wear at work, no foot pain. They're really lightweight, which is nice because I hate heavy shoes, but they do feel a little flimsy. They're a little looser than I'd like on the top, and laces would have been preferable to the bungee cords. However, at half the price of my regular work shoes, they're a great value."
Skechers,Sport Women's Loving Life Memory Foam Fashion Sneaker,B07MDLBYZ9,R1159AF6I7LK9C,"December 18, 2017",2,they're so comfortable in the beginning,"these are very deceiving. they're so comfortable in the beginning, and the slip-on factor is really nice. but once the shoe is worn in a bit, the memory foam is not the highest quality, so it will form to your feet the way they are (as opposed to helping reinforce support for posture or feet pain when standing all day long). So essentially the cushion will just enhance anything about your feet that is causing problems already. So flat feet dont get any help, and, in my case, one of my feet has the habit of landing more on the heel in an uneven way (hard to explain), and the heel part got worn way down really quickly so my heels still lacked cushion and felt like they were hitting the ground. bought new pair of another brand of shoe a couple months after i got these ones."
Skechers,Sport Women's Loving Life Memory Foam Fashion Sneaker,B07MDLBYZ9,RX6U0P92Z31VZ,"September 10, 2018",5,That rare combo of cute and comfy!,"If you read my other reviews you'll see I tend to purchase many pairs of shoes I find that I love so that I won't be in the situation of being without. I hate it when a fave model gets discontinued! I've lost track if I have purchased 4 or 5 of these..I think it's 5. Well no, actually  the very first pair I bought several years ago and THEN after I wore those to holesville, I have since purchased 4 or 5 more on amazon. ( I have a stockpile in my attic). So yes, you could say I'm a fan. They have that magical combo of being cute AND comfy - so so rare in shoes these days. Sizing - I can only share my experience. I am a standard 8.5, with narrow & long feet. The 8 actually fits me perfectly, but I do like my shoes a little snug. So it's my experience that they run 1/2 size larger than normal. Since 8.5 is my normal size, and the 8 fits me perfectly. But again I do have narrow feet. I'm not sure if giving this shoe 5 stars will make more people buy & the manufacturer keep making them (hopefully)... or if it will make more people buy and make them go out of stock sooner. In any case I have my 5 pairs so hopefully I'm good..But I do wish sketcher would keep making them! PS: My ONE beef with these shoes is that they don't have real laces, they have ""fake"" laces which are sewn in. Since my feet are quite narrow I like having real laces so I can make my shoes fit snug. But never fear THERE IS A SOLUTION. For every pair (I think I'm on my 3rd pair in 5 years now) I find the one spot where the fake laces are sewn into the laces holes (it's just in ONE spot, on the inside facing side) and I take a pair of scissors and just cut the thread that keeps the fake laces sewn in. You can then un-lace the fake laces and PUT REAL LACES IN. So if you hate fake laces like I do, never fear it's quite easy to use real laces with these. UPDATE: I just bought another color (light green) than the only other color I had previously bought (black) and the heel did in fact rub and give me a slight blister at first, something that never happened with the other pairs. It goes away, but I guess some of the backs are more rigid and blister-inducing than others, depending on the color or just the pair you get. I would suggest ordering several pairs to try, then returning the ones that don't fit as well."

Unfortunately, I just wasted 39.95 plus tax on these Skechers shoes. I bought them on 8/11 and they seemed to fit just fine until after wearing them once, I had heel blisters. I gave them to a coworker who wears a half-size smaller than me and she enjoyed wearing them for 2 days until the sole of the shoe came detached from the body of the shoe. I tried posting a photo of the shoe on here, but the site would not let me do that. Bottom line is I got gypped. Don't let the same thing happen to you! Lesson learned."

I have been having a love/hate relationship with them for weeks. I love the color, and I love the no-tie laces. They have lots of cushion and are a size 10. My foot is a solid size 10. I've tried to run outdoors and on the treadmill with them. They work. They are a little loose in the ankle. I have had no-tie skechers before, but those, the lace part was always tight. These are pretty loose. I wish I could tighten them some how so that I could run in them more comfortably. Right now, they don't feel that secure. But, that's my own fault and not the shoe. These are marketed as a walking shoe, not a running shoe. That's just me trying to do everything with one pair of shoes. For walking, hiking they are great. I haven't had any problems in that area. They do get pebbles stuck in the bottoms, but all my shoes have always had that issue. One other thing is that they don't have a traditional ""tongue"" that most sneakers have. That was a little odd, but it doesn't affect the performance of the shoe at all. Also, I use pretty thin socks. I think, in the winter, I will try a thicker sock and see if that helps with the looseness. Maybe sizing down would work on most people that want to try this shoe, but they would never fit me if I tried it. Oh well. I'm happy overall."

The inside heel material has started to come off, every time I take off the shoes it gets lifted up more. +++Other than that, I like the little extra bounce I get, good for walking after being broken in, a few months in and they've held up well looking new (minus the heel).

However, this pair is made completely different. These are thicker, taller soles, and a little hard to put on. I had to use a shoe spoon. I ordered 1/2 size up as usually Skechers runs 1/2 size. They fit well, even with my gold toe socks. That is good news, so won't have to wear super thin socks. I usually wear 8 1/2, but always get 9 in Skechers. I gave them a bit of a low score simply because they do not feel like Memory Foam at all! I think the memory foam may be a very thin layer about 1/2 inch thick, layed on top of the lining. And at the end of the toe are on my right shoe, there is a bit of a rise, which hopefully will flatten out as I wear them. My left foot is my larger foot, and it doesn't have a rise in the left shoe at all.

I like the easy on, easy off part but the reviews I read about these on shoe magazine sites was all bull poop. I wish I could return them. Ankles are loose too quick, no arch support, traction is trashier than flip flops from the dollar store. I nearly fell twice in restaurant bathrooms in less than two weeks.  That's how bad it is.

The shoe's are wonderful, my only complaint is I need a tad more arch support. Other than that my feet feel good all day with the memory foam. I have a pair already with white soles & rainbow elastic. Needed all black for work. So I knew what I was getting. If you have to be on your feet all day on hard floors & you have older feet these are a God send!"
Skechers,Sport Women's Loving Life Memory Foam Fashion Sneaker,B07MDLBYZ9,RG4DRPDQ8SDRP,"March 30, 2019",5,Perfect!!,UPDATE. SO AFTER WEARING THEM FOR OVER A WEEK..I NOTICED THAT THE MEMORY FOAM IS AWFUL. MY HEELS HURT LIKE CRAZY!! AND THAT WAS ONLY AFTER TWO HOURS OF WORK!! EVEN MY CHEAP WALMART MEMORY FOAM ONES ARE BETTER.  They are attractive and i get many compliments but they are not to be used for longer than 2 hours. Heels will hurt!!! Love them!! Very pretty colorful and the momory foam is great!! I bought them for work. 12 hour shifts as a caregiver. And the colors are pretty! I bought the black sole ones. I'm usually a size 9.5 and thats what i bought and they fit perfectly!! And the price was great! Im very happy with my purchase.

I got my first pair last year while working at an Amazon fulfillment center as a picker. Pickers walk A LOT and I needed something comfy. Not only did it feel like I was walking on marshmallows they lasted over a year of being worn every day! So I got these of course for my 2nd pair. These are my first slip ons that I like and can wear all day. Awesomeness!

But there is a shiny sketchers label tag on the top of the shoe which I personally don't like the look of.

They fit my needs so well it's a little shocking!  The non-slip soles make work and everyday tasks so much simpler.  The steel toe is better than any steel toe I found while looking.  I didn't even see that it had memory foam and that it was teflon!  I have a job that's hard on my feet and shoes and I think these will last me a very long time.  Great buy!

The area around the toes was cramped, I suspect the steel toe is to be blamed. I’ve worn many steel toed shoes over the past 18+ years and these were the first that didn’t fit well. Sadly being a tall female, needing a size 11, the options are slim for my color preferences."

These shoes are great.  They've kept me from getting tetanus from walking on a floor with a million rusty nails sticking up and old carpet staples. I haven't slipped in the rainy weather.  I like that they don't really look like work shoes.  The only problem I had was the size.  I've worn an 8.5 for as long as I can remember. I have other skechers in an 8.5. I ordered an 8.5 and they fell off my feet.  I ordered an 8 and my feet still swam around in them, so I ordered a 7.5.  I haven't worn a 7.5 since I was a child."

These were perfect! I really like my skechers regular shoes, so I knew what to expect with the actual shoe. They are exactly as I hoped. They do have the air cooled memory foam in them like some of the regular shoes. My first time wearing them I wore them all day and went up and down a lot of stairs, and my feet didn't hurt afterwards. It just took a little getting used to the extra added weight in the toe area."

They are extremely comfortable.  My only complaint is that the my heel keeps coming out of the back of the shoe.  I have tightened the shoe laces as much as I can without cutting off circulation lol.  I normally wear a 6.5, but that wasn't offered so I got the 7.  I don't really feel like the shoe is too big tho.  I have found this to be a problem for me in almost all low steel toed shoes for whatever reason.  There is room in the toe box.  Shoes seem slip resistant.  I walk on concrete with oil spilled on the floor and haven't had any issues.  Overall, I like these shoes and would recommend.  The price was really reasonable so I hope they hold up."

I can say the Sketchers have good foot support, but the toe is narrower than the Keen.  So it will be a little tighter on the fit in the toes.  On the bright side, the design allows some of us with bigger feet to not look like we are wearing clown shoes.  It has a design that allows the shoe to look longer, not wider."

Wow, what a great deal.  I have had them about 3 months now and they are just what I was looking for. They are protective, durable and stylish.  My only complaint is the laces don't stay tied, so you have to double tie them, or you'll be trippin'.  I have always loved wearing Sketchers outside of work so I was so happy to find these, I am sure I will have them for years to come. Definitely recommend these and the fit is just right."
Skechers,for Work Women's Bisco Slip Resistant Work Shoe,B01HEV6T0C,R1XXOWPZ4W7N8V,"July 24, 2019",2,Nice looking shoe but there is something going on in the toe area,"These shoes looks great out of the box. But don't try to wear them for 12 hrs on your feet.. yes the have memory foam and yes they are comfortable but the toe area is to tight.. at first I thought these might work but longer I had them on ,the worse they got. my big toe kept rubbing against something and after my 12 hour shift.. I felt inside of them where it was hurting the steel toe part where it comes down attached to the shoe has a bulky feel like it's pushed out in one place where my big toe lands every time I step.. so if you work on your feet all day long don't buy these.. but a nice looking shoe but looks won't get you through a long work day without your feet hurting."

I have a pair of Sketchers that I love so when I saw these shoes, I didn't hesitate to order them.  They were absolutely comfortable from the moment I first put them on.  Because some reviewers mentioned smaller toe space and these do not come in wide width, I ordered a half size up and with normal socks they fit perfectly!  And they are much cuter than clunky work boots with no give or flexibility.  Order with confidence!!!"

It's comfortable enough for me.  The only thing I can say is that the design dot is coming off.  It didn't on the other shoe.  I'd rather that there was no design if it will just come off. I wasn't even wearing it a week yet. Other than that, it's pretty good."

Skechers,Sport Women's Energy Sneaker,B000PGR75U,R3A1MGORAKZ5IM,"November 5, 2016",5,I love Skechers footwear,"I love Skechers footwear. I happened to get this pair of Skechers at a really great price (I love the deals I get on Amazon as a Prime Member). I'm a little uneasy buying footwear online since sizes aren't always correct, but I took a shot and it paid off. I'm a size 9 and I ordered a size 9 and the fit is perfect; not too tight and not too loose and extremely comfortable. In my opinion, Skechers are a very good choice and I paid way less than I would have at an actual shoe store. The look, the feel and the comfort have me thinking about getting another pair. Definitely a win on this purchase! Now that I know that the sizing is accurate, I'm thinking of buying a pair for a friend who doesn't have a lot of money and would absolutely appreciate a new pair of sneakers, especially Skechers! Amazon has some amazing deals, you just have to look at all your options. Ordering from Amazon is far easier than wasting gas driving all the way to the mall! I'm very happy with my new Skechers!"

Not only did they have them in my size (women's 11 - yeah!  I know.  I have Hobbit feet.)  but the width is perfect.  So glad I got them. As far as comfort goes, I get up at 5 to commute an hour to where I work.  I get off the train and walk 5 blocks and am in them for the 8 hours I am at work.  Walk back the 5 blocks, commute and then go to college at night for another 4 hours.  These shoes are light weight enough and comfortable enough that I really don't notice I have them on most of the time.  When a shoe can go that long on my foot, it's amazing, as I am normally a barefoot person when I can get away with it.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!!"
Skechers,Sport Women's Energy Sneaker,B000PGR75U,R2ATX28BRY2USR,"December 12, 2015",5,Sketchers have support in the right places.,I love sketchers shoes and they always last me a long time.  These shoes have such support in all the right places in the heal and in the front.  These shoes came laced up in just the coolest way that would have taken me forever to do and probably would not have had them as perfect as they came. In other shoes I wear a 7 1/2 wide but these seem a bit wide but it will still be good as at least my foot is able to have plenty of room. I could have gotten a 7 1/2 regular and would have been good as well.  Great and durable and Sketchers are made to last.

However, it doesn't seem to be the correct size as stated.  I wear a Size 8M in all of my shoes and sneakers.  This sneaker seems to be maybe a 7 1/2.  I wore them to the mall once for about an hour; I had to literally take them off in the Mall and rub my feet.  These sneakers are too short (no way a true 8 and too narrow)  I put them in my closet with intentions on returning them for maybe an 8 1/2 only because they are too short and hurt my big toe.  Unfortunatley, I've been ill and forgot about returning them until today when I looked in my closet and realized I hadn't returned them for a 8 1/2.  I love the sneakers they just seem to be tight and short; not a true Size 8.  Otherwise, I love them.  The price and quality of the sneaker is great.  I think it's not true to size as advertised.  Please let me know if I can return them for an 8 1/2W.  I normally wear a 8M but I would to up the size for these sneakers.  Thank you so much."

I normally wear a women's 9.5 and I have ordered two different pairs and they are both too small. So I went to a store and tried on a 9.5 and it was also too small. They did not have a size 10 so I ordered a pair online. The size 10 is on the right and it actually looks and feels smaller than the size 9.5 on the left that I kept because I had to have a pair of shoes and I wear them even though they kill my feet. What is going on with Sketcher Shoes? There seems to be no consistency. FYI, I have tried a few different makes of Sketchers and they all appear to be the same.  This is my third pair I recently ordered and none of them fit. two size 9.5 and one size 10. My previous purchases have been size 9.5."

I don't know what happened, but they have changed the fit and they hurt my feet.  They are significantly more narrow at the forefoot, to the point I can't use the shoes for running or biking as I always have.  None of my other shoes feel any different so I'm certain it's the Skechers, not my feet.  I don't know if I got knockoff shoes (I bought black ones for work and white ones for exercise and they both fit the same) or Skechers has changed the sizing.  Either way, my favorite shoes aren't my favorite shoes any more."

I have arthritis in my feet, plus plantar fasciitis/heel spurs. I tried wearing them twice, and after only four hours on my feet I could barely walk. I put carbon fiber insoles in them and still had little support. I wanted to return them but missed the return window and now don't have the money to buy something else."

I noticed the edging part is different than in the past it does not seem very strong compared to before, sketchers needs to quit cutting corners. The insole is a regular insole not that memory foam garbage they are putting on the other pairs seems to wear out in half the time so I am trying to avoid that. This pair is also real leather not the synthetic stuff that makes your feet stink cuz they cant breathe."
Skechers,Sport Women's Energy Sneaker,B000PGR75U,R3M7MDY51W0ECJ,"September 12, 2019",5,Very satisfied with these shoes.,"These are really nice shoes for the price. I work in healthcare so I'm on my feet 12+ hours a day. I walk roughly 6-9 miles on an easy day at work and on the busier days, 14 miles is not unheard of. I needed a pair of shoes that would look nice and be sturdy enough to last with all that walking. They also had to be comfortable and support my high arches and instep. The first time I worked in them, I found them to be exactly what I hoped they would be. No pinching, rubbing or irritation to my feet at all... Just very comfortable shoes. You do need to be careful if you walk across a freshly mopped floor in them...its like gliding across an ice skating rink. I won't make that mistake again! Otherwise, these shoes are worth every penny and then some. I love them."

This particular shoe has been my favorite and I buy them about every 2 years or so. I ordered a pair and was so excited until I tried them on. They don't fit the same, the sole on the right shoe was lopsided putting my foot on an awkward angle. I exchanged for the exact same thing and again, received an oddball lopsided right shoe.

Skechers,Sport Women's Energy Sneaker,B000PGR75U,R2RQWH48QRE75I,"August 10, 2015",3,A little too slim fitting for me...,"These are great shoes by just looking at them, they have the wonderful hard rubber throughout the whole sole that means you don't lose the tread on them within the first 3 months. But this pair were just a little too snug on each side of my upper foot in the toe area, though to be fair, my feet are on the wider side. I can wear normal sizes in many styles but some are just too narrow. The length seemed like it could be fine but it was hard to tell with the tightness on the sides. I can't go up half a size due to having a size 11 women's foot, but I just ordered a 11W to see if the wide version might fit better and make them wearable. I love Skechers as a brand and while I love the D'Lites line, I hate the foam like inner sole that wears out too quickly. The Sports line has the better more durable sole that I need as someone who is walking around all day long, everyday (as a nanny) and so I really hope that the wides will fit great. I have 4 other styles and another (as well as the Sports Energy) on the way. I have been wearing nothing but Skechers since 2003 and I absolutely love them."
Skechers,Sport Women's Energy Sneaker,B000PGR75U,R35OHKKDTIRSGU,"October 7, 2016",5,Nice quality shoe for a decent price,"Skecher shoes have always been one of my favorite brands.  I am amazed at how expensive these types of shoes have gotten lately.  I've had foot surgery on both feet so I need my shoes to fit well without being too snug.  The skechers brand has always fit the bill.  They are well made and last me a long time.  I put in a 10 hour day in these shoes.  I'm pretty active so the shoes get a real work out each day.  I like the looks as well as I am one of those goofy people who likes a clean white shoe for work.  I also like the rather thick bottom that gives me a great barrier from feeling the rough surface of a parking lot.  Very comfortable, nice looking and I feel like my foot is well protected."
Skechers,Sport Women's Energy Sneaker,B000PGR75U,R2WF8QFSP087FW,"May 31, 2018",1,"One size larger, perhaps?","These were very uncomfortable.  The tongue of the shoe dug into my ankle.  This made them very uncomfortable.  Not at all what I was hoping for!  I did end up ordering the Skechers' D'Lites instead one half size larger, and I am very happy with these, though I think I could have gone up a whole size.  Something to think about if you are considering which size to order:  from my experience, I would suggest trying one size larger than you would normally wear."
Skechers,Sport Women's Energy Sneaker,B000PGR75U,R2SC0GWNZ8IZTM,"November 29, 2019",3,READ THE REVIEWS.. These have changed FYI..,"I am not too sure what happened to Sketchers but the sneakers I’ve worn for many years now are too narrow and are not true to size for me, this pair runs too small and these are not as comfortable as the previous ones I’ve purchased.. I had to return these and ordered a full size up which I’ve never had to do.. READ THE REVIEWS.. I love the look and feel of Sketchers, I still love the look but the feel is quite odd and extremely different than my last purchases.. Having to wear a full size up is just so strange since I’ve always worn the same size for literally over a decade.. SOMETHING DEFINITELY CHANGED SO JUST BE A LITTLE BIT CAUTIOUS WHEN ORDERING THIS PARTICULAR PAIR.. They are narrow and the right shoe itself seems very OFF.. Scroll the reviews and you will also see a few ladies who also speak of this strangeness as well.. I will keep these sneakers as the price is great, but I do really hope that these changes that they have made will not stay in effect.."
Skechers,Sport Women's Energy Sneaker,B000PGR75U,R18SPZ9HB7D287,"December 5, 2017",3,Sketchers women black. Skechers!,"Sketches are great. This one is not as soft as previous pairs purchased. Must be a defective recall. The right shoe rubs up against my toe after 6-7 hours it hurts, bad. This shoe causes me to walk perfectly to adjust to it's shape and form. That part is great! For just four to five hours total standing or a 6 or 7 hour shift with a lot of sit down it is amazing. Any time more for this one pair and ow. I am looking for an 7-10 hour shoe, in women's work. I have purchased these shoes for years 5 stars, I'd give 10 sstars. Not this pair. Not sure what's the problem with them. They are great for 5 hours tops."
Skechers,Sport Women's Energy Sneaker,B000PGR75U,R3VWAW26PFKYW2,"March 13, 2016",4,Run Small,"I wish I had listened to the reviewers that said they were a bit small.  It is TRUE!  I have ordered my regular size in every type of shoe and never had a problem before.  I will probably order another pair 1/2 size up in the future. When I first tried them on, they just seemed a bit small.  Silly me, I decided to wear them and surely they would stretch just a bit.  Oh no they didn't and now I can't return them.  My fault.  Other than that, they have a nice foot bed.  They spring right along as I walk."
Skechers,Sport Women's Energy Sneaker,B000PGR75U,R1R6Y1D9BDF60H,"November 10, 2019",5,Ultimately a perfect fit & look great,"**update- these are broken in and super comfortable & fit very well so I take back the need for sizing up, just give the time & they'll be your fave pair.** These are a great style but just a tad small & tight in the toe area & I do not have wide feet. If they had 1/2 sizes I would recommend to go up a half size because I think a whole size would be too much unless you were thick sock. Perhaps I'm spoiled from the Delite collection. I'll break them in & if they get more comfortable I'll update this review."
Skechers,Sport Women's Energy Sneaker,B000PGR75U,R1GD3DHBP9LFAD,"January 30, 2020",5,"Great shoes, but they run small","I’ve always loved Skechers, and I’ve been wearing them for going on 20 years now. These definitely don’t disappoint and I’m very happy with them! One thing I recommend though is getting them in 1/2 to a full size larger than what you’d normally wear, as these particular shoes run small. I had a baby nine months ago and gained 40 pounds, which is the most I’ve ever weighed in my entire life, and the extra weight flattened the arches of my feet causing me to go from a 6 1/2 shoe size to a 7. But some of the reviews for the shoes said they run small so I decided to order them in a 7 1/2, and I’m very glad I did because a 7 1/2 fits perfect, so a 7 would’ve been too small. Despite the fact that they run small, I still recommend this line of Skechers."
Skechers,Sport Women's Energy Sneaker,B000PGR75U,R1I24EDVUGHFC2,"September 13, 2019",3,Insoles not so great.....,"I have bought more Sketchers than any other shoe because they fit better and the insoles are perfect for MY feet. So I naturally when I seen the new Sketchers Sport for women, I thought they would be like all the others I have purchased in the past. While I love the basic white color of the shoe, I'm NOT impressed with the insoles I've been accustomed to. There is no memory foam or arch in the shoes. Pretty flat and hard actually. I had to purchase several different insoles to accommodate MY feet and that is something I've never done with Skechers. That's not to say other folks wouldn't like them....depends on how your feet like comfyness!"
Skechers,Sport Women's Energy Sneaker,B000PGR75U,R2GKUVWRSJGRUA,"September 14, 2015",2,"Cute Shoes - BUT, Terrible Fit and No Support","I love Skechers and had high hopes for these - they are cute shoes and I like the materials, but they have a funky fit. I typically wear a 6.5 Wide - I have tried the Skechers in medium width and found the footbed to be too narrow for me, so I ordered these in a 6.5 Wide. They were comfortable for about an hour before I started having issues. They almost seem a bit too wide - my foot seems to slide forward, causing my toes to smash up against the end of the shoe, resulting in sore toes. I put a gel, ball-of-foot pad in the shoes, but it only crowded my toes even more. The other issue I have is that there is not enough padding/arch support, which is aggravating to my Plantar Fasciitis. I'm planning to switch out the insole for something cushier. UPDATE:  The more I wear these shoes, the more painful my feet become.  AND, the insole is glued in, so it can't be replaced easily.  So, I'm sending them back."

I am a teacher and I am also 6 months pregnant, so I was looking for something to wear day to day (long days!) that wouldn't kill my feet. I have worn Sperry's and while I like them, they don't come close to the level of comfort of these. The lining in these is really squishy and provides good support. The inside of my Sperry's feels flat and my feet end up aching by the end of the day. I purchased these back when they were the style with the laces that tie and was pleased with the quality and comfort then. I like the non-tie style even better! I have had several pairs of these through the last few years and they have held up extremely well. I can throw them in the washer in a laundry bag and they come out looking as good as new with their same shape. (I don't recommend drying them in the dryer, however.) My only wish is that they had more colors!"

In the pictures of all the shoes in this style, the laces are tucked. I thought these were like those but they actually were fixed and not adjustable. This meant I couldn’t tighten them where they didn’t slip on my heel. Great shoes otherwise. I just needed them to tighten. Had to return because they didn’t fit tightly enough."

These shoes are sooo comfy!!! I originally bought a 5.5 which is my normal size but with some no-show socks, I found that it was too tight so I had to go up to a 6 so that my feet didn't feel suffocated. Even the 6 with the socks sometimes after a long day does feel a bit tight around the top part of my foot, but not enough for me to increase to a 6.5.  The heel size is perfect at the 6.  I do love these shoes!  I wish though, that the Sketchers logo wasn't so large/prominent as I prefer less brand logo visibility. The gray goes with everything but it's a bit of a pain to wash when they get stained, especially when I walk in the NYC rain. Yuck.."

I have 3 of pairs of these in different colors and the other 2 are totally fine. I LOVE the Go Walk line! I LOVE these as they look good with yoga pants (I'm a photographer who's on the ground on lot) so they aren't dressy, but they aren't super casual like tennies either."

The white soul wipes and grey fabric wipes clean easily. They still look new. I really love these! Original review I used prime’s wardrobe service to try on 4 shoes ranging from tradition boat shoe to sleek sneaker. I need a sneaker to chace the kids but really wanted boat style shoe because they look better with a range of bottoms (in my opinion) and voila,  this looks like a boat shoe but a bouncy cushier feel of a great sneaker.  It’s fits securely but overly snug. I’m not worried that they will come off if I need to chance a toddler across the field an up a slide. So I can be cute but an not stuck in a sneaker (which I really only like to wear out for runs or hikes). Very pleased. I don’t want to take them off."
Skechers,Women's Go Walk Lite-15433 Boat Shoe,B071KLKY6W,R2V8NIIEW8B6IS,"March 23, 2019",4,A great all around travel shoe,"These are comfortable, sturdy shoes. I wore them for a 10 trip in Europe without breaking them in first. They did not disappoint. I'm a heavy heel walker, which leads to heel and knee pain. I didn't feel any pain in these shoes other than the day I walked more than five miles. While the shoes are supportive, go for something sturdier if you'll be walking more than five miles a day. I don't think these shoes are meant for that. I accidentally went for a muddy, steep hike in them (my husband's fault). Clearly these shoes aren't meant for hiking. They worked very well for the city walking I did though. The soles are very grippy on wet cement and tile. They also paired well with several outfits as well as compacted down well enough for my suitcase."

I have a friend at work who wore them in one day and I fell in love. I had been looking for a ""boat shoe"" style and they were adorable. I was able to track them down at DSW in the black version. I tried them on and the Sperry's next to them. They were more comfortable and had a much more padded foot bed while being as light as air. I ended up liking them so much that I came to Amazon to buy a pair in another color and they are just as perfect. I get compliments on them all the time and they are my go to shoes for summer right now. I really don't think you will be disappointed if you give these a shot!"

I almost always wear sandals or flip flops because shoes never fit, but I love these. I bought this pair on Amazon as my second pair. My first pair that I purchased at a Sketchers store was getting dirty and I wanted to get more before they stopped selling them. They are so comfortable I actually forget I am wearing shoes. You can wear without socks or with little liner socks. Looks great with jeans or with a casual dress and denim jacket. Very lightweight. I bring them on all my trips now since they don't take up much room or weight in my bag."

I had bought a similar pair not too long ago that had laces and I purchased Hickies to replace the laces so I wouldn’t have ties. Then Skechers came out with this shoe that has bungees and I’m in love. I bought 3 pairs in different colors. I wear one pair of them literally every single day. They are the most comfortable, most stylish casual shoe I’ve ever owned and as long as Skechers makes these, I’ll be buying them! Love, love love them!"

Because the other shoe was soooo comfortable, I thought I would try one in a medium width to wear without socks.  This is ideal.  The stretch laces make it easy to slip on.  Footbed is cushy, supportive, and COMFORTABLE.  Toe box is wide enough to expand toes appropriately to enhance balance (important for geriatrics like me).  Great shoe.  Will definitely take on the cruise I'm taking in 3 weeks.  I suspect it will be ideal for wearing around the ship.  Will wear the other with socks for sightseeing."

I have no toes and my feet have widened so it makes it harder for me to 1)Find a smaller, wide foot shoe and 2)find a smaller, wide foot shoe that's fashionable. Most medical shoes are hideous in my opinion. This isn't my first pair of Sketchers. Other pairs I had to send back because the opening was too narrow(they weren't lace up) but that's on me wishing for things of the past. These shoes are super comfortable and even when my feet swell they don't cut off circulation. I just came back from a trip from Disney World and while I was on a scooter for the majority of the time when I had to stand and walk around for various lines and rides the insert and cushioning soles really did help. This won't be my last pair of Sketchers."

And I like the fabric upper better than some of the other Sketchers  sneakers I have seen and purchased in the last couple of years.  The fabric doesn’t look like synthetic as some do.  And the fabric seems to have a tiny bit of warmth to it in cold weather.  I have had a little trouble with sizing with Sketchers in the last 2 years.  They don’t all fit the same anymore.  I used to always wear a 6 in Sketchers sneakers but sometimes now need 6 1/2.  Intended to buy these bigger, a 7,  so I could wear 2 pairs of socks for a cold weather trip.  I accidentally ordered a 7 1/2 and decided to keep them because they were quite comfortable with 2 pair of socks.  They are too big with no socks or a thin pair."

It held up for me through almost 10 miles of walking a day, and only left me with one blister- but I think that was due to the shoe being a little too large. I usually wear an 8 1/2, but I honestly probably could've gotten anywhere from a 7 1/2 to 8 to make it fit better. It has wonderful support and will hold up through a lot of walking. I'm not a runner so I haven't worn them running, but I have gone to the gym and used the elliptical in them, and they are perfect.

This is actually my third consecutive pair, and I love the soft but tight weave, the comfy insoles and the way that my feet feel sliding them on. They seem to last me 8-10 mos/pair and are a pretty reasonable price for such a good pair of shoe... I’m seriously considering keeping an extra pair around for casual use, too.

I felt very motivated to write a review on these shoes though, so I could sing their praises. I love them and wonder where they have been all my life! I’m very picky about shoes and comfort, and I find these to be lightweight, super comfortable, and really nice looking. I got the black/coral. The color is beautiful and adds a little zing to the shoe. Very sharp without overdoing it. For reference, as a tall gal, I’m a perfect size 10.5. So for me the question usually becomes, do I need a size 10 or 11? I went with the size 11 and they fit me well."

I’d even tried other Skechers.  These Flex Appeal 2.0’s came highly recommended by a coworker and are a God send.  I did have to order a half size up,  but the fit is Perfect.  The price is right so I hope to keep enough in the pipeline to never have the shoe break down or awful foot pain again!"

I already had an older model of these Skechers that lasted a long time so I knew I would want this brand again. Although I initially had a problem with the shoe size (my shoe size varies from brand to brand) exchange was easy and quick and now it fits perfectly! It gives me enough room around my toes, the memory foam insoles are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! It feels like I am stepping on clouds all day, it is easy to slide your feet into the shoes, and they are very light as well. I do recommend this brand to anyone!"

I only paid $31 and the colors are great. They give you two shoe lace color options. Grey and pink (they do not look coral to me). As for running. The insoles don’t have the cusion you need in my opinion. They almost feel like shoes you would wear for crossfit. But for walking the dog, which is why I bought them. They’re perfect. :)"

They are not uncomfortable but I wouldn't hail them as comfortable either (meh and no arch support). I would NEVER use them for any kind of exercise. They do not support your foot in any way. You WILL get injured. The laces refuse to stay tied too which is weird. I use them for work at a vet office so they serve their purpose, but I will not be buying these again (especially seeing as I bought these in January and they are completely trashed by June- and again I only use them for work)."

I don't like wasting my money on knock off shoes. I'm trying to contact the seller to try to return these shoes. I think they're defective as they don't let my feet plant flat on the ground, they push my heels inward causing back pain when I wear them. I had my niece try them on today and she said the same thing. I know I can return them but I've been wearing them for about a week thinking I'd get used to them but I just can't. Please let me know if I can return them, or maybe get a pair that aren't defective.  Thank you."

However, the toe box is a slight bit tight across the top. It should not be that way as I always get shoes a half size longer than normal because they seem to all be a bit shorter than they used to be. I normally wear a narrow size but the use I have will work fine as I wear socks that are fairly thick. When I learn what to look for I will likely get more of the Skechers. The price is so good, and the choice is really good too. I would be happy to suggest Skechers to a friend."

Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 2.0 Sneaker,B01N90ZQ76,R3H927XNVKLQJV,"June 13, 2018",4,"Comfortable for long hours, just wish they would last longer","I'm nearly flat footed and I work on my feet, with constant walking. The memory foam currently is the most comfortable option for me. My feet still hurt after a shift, but they hurt less with these shoes compared to others. My only wish (and reason for making it 4 stars) is that they breathed a little better and that the foam held up for longer. Using them solely (pun not intended) for work, 40 hours a week, I have to replace them about every 4 months. By then, I've worn holes into the insoles at my heels, balls of my feet, and toes. But this is a problem I have with every type of shoes so maybe it's just me."
Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0 Sneaker,B07CYV8GH2,R2UP6UP2B3VU1L,"April 13, 2019",5,Awesome!,Awesome walking shoes.  We walked over 40 miles at Walt Disney World and even through a thunderstorm and they were fantastic! Even when they got soaked in the rain they dried quickly and they seem to breathe well so they don’t get stinky! I have a history of some serious leg fractures due to a car accident so the right shoes make all the difference for me. These were great! Will definitely pick up another pair and I highly recommend!

I kept buying the flex 2.0 as old ones wore out, and was dismayed to find recently the 2.0 are no longer offered and now it's the 3.0.  The 3.0 is a nice shoe, the outside is very similar to the 2.0, but the memory foam is not nearly as squishy as the 2.0.  It's comfortable otherwise, but compared to the 2.0 the memory foam doesn't live up to expectations."

I normally like a wide width but have other Skechers in a medium width that fit fine, so I tried these.  Even with lightweight socks they fit great.  Because of the width, I bought a 6.5 when I normally wear a 6.0."
Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0 Sneaker,B07CYV8GH2,R2LIFV649NAHLS,"June 24, 2019",5,Comfortable!,"At last I have found a comfortable walking shoe! Toe box has just enough room, and there's adequate support.  I use them to walk on the treadmill and after an hour or so, they rub a bit on my heels but not to the point of discomfort. I wear them without socks, maybe I won't have the heel issue if I wear a thin sock. I'll be getting another color."
Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0 Sneaker,B07CYV8GH2,R2D2R2XIDMYDVY,"November 21, 2019",2,Comfortable but this 3.0 version is much lower quality that previous versions.,"I love the Sketchers flex sneakers because they are true to size and they are very comfortable. This shoe was just as comfortable as expected but the quality of the past has disappeared with this newest 3.0 version. The edges of the top of the sneaker where the top hole for the laces are are completely unfinished--no stitching at all and you can see fuzz and the white of the inside of the filling. The top of the shoe where it is reinforced for the laces is crooked on the left shoe, so while wearing it looks like your laces cross at a sliding downward angle toward your toes. I have the previous 2.0 version of these shoes and the quality is much better. I thought 3.0 would be a better choice but not I see that newer is NOT always better because Sketchers quality really took a nose dive on this style."

At first they were compfy.  After 8 hours of being on my feet in these, my feet are in pain.  The arch support was all wrong for me because the back side of my arches hurt like no other; not sure if it was from rubbing or from the inserts being too cushy.  I no longer wear these shoes, but a week and a half later after stopping, my arches still have some pain.  The inserts are glued in, so I cannot easily switch them out.  I would have changed the inserts if I had the time to operate on the shoes because the rest of the shoe was really nice. Overall size was as expected.  Because I can't wear these, I gave them away. I went back to wearing Asics."

I bought these for an upcoming trip to London where we are going to do a lot of walking.  I put them on and they were instantly comfortable.  It think I'm going to buy a 2nd pair in a different color.  I got the gray with the pink logo and laces .... my favorite color combination.  I am so happy with my purchase.

Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0 Sneaker,B07CYV8GH2,R845M3GJVOH9P,"February 9, 2020",5,Skechers are the BEST!,I've been wearing the Skechers' brand for over 20 years. They really are a great fit for women's feet and the arch support is better than other brands I've bought. I change up my walk with a few pairs and this one is my latest acquisition! Grey is such a great neutral color and the hot pink laces are the perfect detail! Highly recommend.
Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0 Sneaker,B07CYV8GH2,RTT9O1J6PM64H,"December 15, 2019",2,Insole did not last at all,"I initially liked this shoe very much but after just over a month, I started getting feet pain. It seems that the insole in this shoe has worn out way quicker than I would have ever expected. I've bought plenty of sketchers in the past but these did not last. They were not even my primary shoe. I worked out at the gym in these and occasionally wore them to run errands. This past weekend the pain was so bad I decided to go try on more shoes at a store. Pain instantly gone with a new pair of shoes. I'm hoping these were defective as my new pair is sketchers- giving them another chance here, hope they do not disappoint. Also, I know the pain was from sketchers since another pair I also have are sketchers and those were my primary pair but were slightly older (maybe six months)."

I think its an attractive looking shoe! The quality is tops, I have had other walking shoes that the foam sole has broken down quite quickly, making my feet hurt.  This shoe is as comfy as the day I bought them, NO pain, study construction. I plan to buy again when its time to replace these."

Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0 Sneaker,B07CYV8GH2,R3RCNB1Q7S4BLA,"January 11, 2020",3,Cute shoes but not very comfortable.,I have always purchased Skechers for my work shoes. Usually I buy the Go Runs but am having a hard time finding them so I decided to go with this line instead. I’m not saying they aren’t good shoes but they definitely are not like my others. Usually the Go Runs I buy are super supportive and feel like you are walking on clouds. These are not that way at all. Very thin sole and no arch support. The look of them is super cute but just not practical for my needs. I should note that I do have plantar fasciitis and I’m on my feet for 12 hours per day. These may work for causal wear or light activity but definitely not a 12 hour nursing shift.
Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0 Sneaker,B07CYV8GH2,R2UIRBFXCY9Z7O,"December 5, 2019",1,Wears out FAST,"I work on my feet at a hospital and this is my second pair of Sketchers. Within 2 weeks the back of the shoes rub a hole in them on the heels. I untie them every time before taking them off. I have them laced all the way up and keep them tied firmly. Still this keeps happening. It has rubbed sores on my heels and the within 1 month there is loose broken plastic pieces falling in the interior of the shoe. Very poor quality. On a good note, I do get compliments on how cute they are."
Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0 Sneaker,B07CYV8GH2,R2J7EHBQGNOH9A,"October 24, 2019",4,Very Nice,"I do like these a lot. They are cute and functional. I have had two previous pairs of Sketcher's. This is my first woman's pair. I have found that while the previous Sketchers fit, woman shoes in general fit me better, and this pair of woman's Sketchers did not disappoint. I think they are extremely cute. I wore them today for the first time and got several compliments on them. I would have given these shoes 5 stars, but I don't no the durability of them yet."
Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0 Sneaker,B07CYV8GH2,RTLLE3ATMWV27,"February 9, 2020",2,Disappointing,"I have worn Skechers for several years and always been satisfied.  Lately some of the shoes, including these, are cheap looking and very uncomfortable.  The tongue is not well padded and the shoes are very, very stiff.  Not anywhere near as comfortable as past types.  Plus you can order different colors from the same exact page and receive different types of shoes.  I have been trying to ""break these in"" but they just don't get more comfortable."

Skechers,Women's Flex Appeal 3.0 Sneaker,B07CYV8GH2,R1EO5YI6KMIDF1,"February 7, 2020",4,Nice shoe,"This is my 4th pair of Skechers.  I love these but it seems now that everyone is shortening the laces.  I like to leave my laces fairly loose over my foot as I have issues, this gives me very little laces left to tie.  I also like to double knot to make sure they don't come loose and the laces are not long enough.  None of my other pairs had this problem.  I will exchange the laces for longer ones, but wish I didn't have to do that."
Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,RPUPMNH3B3QVF,"November 21, 2017",3,"If you buy half size up, they may become too big after you break them in.","Day four of wearing these shoes.  What I like:  I love the height because I throw these on with dress pants and jeans, and most of my pants are long, even for  ""average"" length purchased.  The shoes are very warm and comfortable for walking.  I purchased a half size up based on others' reviews.  My thought the minute I put them on initially, ""These fit perfectly; I'm GLAD I ordered up.""  What I don't like:  Day 4:  they're flopping on me.  The fur on the inside has been flattened enough by day four of wear that my feet aren't held in securely like they were 4 days ago.  Now they are flopping on my heals like a flip flop.  And with every step my foot is slipping inside. Now that they've been worn for 4 days I cannot return. So I may ask Santa for a pair in my regular size instead of spending an additional $55 myself.  Clearly I think the shoes are worth the purpose I purchased them for (throw on instead of a tied tennis shoe, walking on weekends and to/from work).  But now that they're floppy, they're hard to walk in.  So everyone who posted they're snug and returned them, you may have just needed to walk in them a few days, and then they would have fit perfectly."
Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,R1CYEBLXNETBTH,"November 10, 2016",5,the BEST.,"Oh My! I ordered these slippers/shoes/boots/clogs a few weeks ago and COULD NOT be happier with them! I get a few new pairs of slippers every fall, and I prefer ones that are slip-ons and have thick, chunky soles so I can run out to get the mail, or run a quick errand and not have to put on regular shoes or boots. These are by far, my favorite ones I have ever owned - they are so sturdy - not just the soles but the sides and top are thick and supportive as well. The interior fur is thick enough that it feels like I'm slipping my feet into little pillows; one thing I can't stand about others I've owned is when the inner fur gets all matted down after wearing them just a few times. That hasn't been an issue with these at all so far and I don't see it happening in the near future, either. They are heavy clogs, but that does not bother me one bit - I actually prefer it because it makes them feel so sturdy and my feet feel safe! I love these and hope they never stop making them!"
Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,RLCE4M2B5D1SH,"February 2, 2016",4,Beautiful,"Beautiful shoe. Comfortable and warm. Sizing runs a tad narrow and small. Be sure to size up a half size. I went for chestnut color. Colors are darker in person. The chestnut is a light brown and the ""brown"" is a super dark espresso brown in person (see photos attached of both colors)."
Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,R3OHTWOFBQ9DHW,"September 3, 2013",5,IN LOVE! comfy & very well made!,"Fast shipping! I wasn't sure about these shoes, reviews I read were mixed. I was pleasantly surprised, the fit is true to size. I wear an 8 in slippers, clogs and sandals and a 7.5 in heels. These can be worn with jeans. I bought them to wear as slippers around the house in the winter months. When I put them on today I thought they would be way to hot to wear now in the summer, not true. They actually keep my feet cool and are sooo comfy. I got the black. The only downside is they are heavier than I expected, but that's ok, will work out my legs. I highly recommended these shoes, you won't be disappointed. Cheers!"
Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,R3L7D8QGADN0XI,"December 18, 2017",5,Excellent product for a GREAT price!,"I am a fan of sketchers since their sneakers have reliably been comfortable and long lasting on my picky feet. After having another pair of slippers last less then a year, I found these. My only complaint is the lack of colors.  Dark purple and Dark green would be excellent additions in my opinion. They arrived on time, well packaged, clean and in excellent condition. These can be worn with a light sock or comfortably without. They keep your feet extremely warm, are very stylish and can be worn as actual shoes if you are not dealing with precipitation. I walked easily through a spill in my kitchen without falling and on an icey drive way with ease. I really appreciate the excellent function and design of these while being luxuriously comfortable and very cute. The price point is excellent as well since my slippers cost me between ten and twenty dollars on sale and never make it through an entire year. My two warnings are you may find you are not comfortable in the pair you order, I encourage you to get a replacement and see if that fixes it. I accidently received two pairs and tried them both on before returning. There was a marked difference between the comfort in the two that I believe is just personal preference and not a manufacturing or quality defect. So these are worth sending them back a few times to find the right ones for your particular feet. Last, these are not lightweight like most house slippers. They are more like a clog. This helps them function well but I thought I would note it incase you are looking for lightweight shoes.  I hope to eventually purchase them for everyone in the family."

Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,R30GHF9VPWDKUA,"January 2, 2018",5,Lovely and warm,"These are a two-in-one purchase.  They're a clog and a slipper.  They are definitely wearable outside.  I wear mine to the grocery store.  I've even worn them to work.  I wouldn't necessarily say these are the best lounging slippers because they are quite heavy on the foot; however, if you need something quick to put on to run outside and get the mail, or chase the dog, these are for you.  And they are exceptionally warm.  I have ceramic tile floor in my kitchen which can be hard on the legs after a little while; I wear these when I'm baking or making dinner and they're perfect for reducing the strain I experience when in my bare feet."
Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,R1FZA3MJPHUPSS,"October 5, 2012",5,Very Unique Shoe...I Love Them!,"I was hoping these were a ""shoe"" and not look like a slipper since I plan on wearing them when I'm out and about this winter.  They're definately a SHOE, not a slipper.  Doesn't look at all like slippers.  They're comfortable and warm.  I was a bit concerned after reading the reviews that they might run small...I didn't find that to be true.  I'm tall and I wear a size 10 and these shoes ran true to size. My foot width is between a medium and a wide and these are a comfortable fit. They have a thick lining that feels really warm and soft and I don't see a reason one would need to wear thick socks with these, but if you prefer thick socks, these will probably feel snug, unless you wear a narrow shoe size.  The style:  Think the traditional Sketcher clog like this but with a Doc Martin rugged sole, which is what makes them look nothing like a slipper.  They initially feel a little heavy after wearing sandals all summer, but after a couple of minutes of walking in them I naturally adjusted to the weight and feel of them.  The sole is soft, rubbery and grips, not that hard plastic that's slippery when it cold, wet or icy out.  The sole is 1.5"" at the toe and 2"" at the heel.  I measured because it actually looks chunkier than that, but the thickness was as described in the shoe details. The inner is a soft furry lining that feels like excellent quality acrylic and the upper is made of smooth tightly tanned leather suede.  I have used the spray water-proofing on this type of shoe leather before with great results so I will most likely do the same with these...Almost a must if you live in the wintery snow belt to protect from all the salt. (A couple of light mistings, drying between each misting works really well). They're comfortable and fashionable, will go with jeans, yoga pants, active wear and slacks.  I'm super pleased with these and will probably order another pair in a different color. Update: In just the few days I've been wearing these, I've gotten multiple compliments and requests for where they could be found, so get them quick before they're sold out!"
Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,R7AWKGOZ479AW,"November 20, 2017",5,Comfortable & Cute,"I got 6.5 and it is perfect fit. I have enough room for thin socks. If you like thick socks I would suggest a half size up from normal size you wear. They are indeed heavy but i like it. They feel sturdy and safe, lots of tread to prevent slips. I live in California so it’s not snowy or anything but it is getting a bit chilly out. I am always reluctant to give up my sandles when hot weather fades. I like boots but they can make me overheat quickly. These shoes feel like the perfect solution as they have the warmth of fuzziness yet are open in back so my tootsies can still breath and easily eacape if need be as they slide on and off easy! I like them a lot and would recommend."
Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,R5I820UNEO5YT,"August 25, 2019",5,Feet feeling pampered for the first time ever!,"I am 65, obese, & have had flat, cold feet my entire life. The tops of my feet are very painful to touch due to many old breaks & other injuries. I require shoes with a wide toebox & shoes that do not put a lot of pressure on the tops of my feet. I have worn the same pair of size 11 UGGS for the past 5 years, but they have finally come apart. They are silly-expensive, so I spent hours looking at other brands before ordering my first pair of Skechers. They arrived late in the evening when my feet were swollen & painful from the day. The left shoe felt a little snug that first night, but in the morning both shoes greeted my feet like a warm hug. As my feet swelled during the day, the clog slippers continued to feel wonderful, warm & supportive to my feet. Being used to UGGS, these do not seem heavy at all. I have been living in them since they arrived a week ago. The fit is perfect; no sliding around inside. Toebox: quite ample. One caveat: don't just order your usual size. Look at the chart. Verify your foot length by standing on a ruler. The variation in sizes between brands is amazing! All things considered, these shoes are a dream come true. My feet feel pampered for the first time ever! And I could purchase at least 4 pair of these for the price of one pair of my old UGGS."

I was so excited to get a pair in black too!  I immediately reordered this shoe (after one shoe was destroyed by the pup) and lo and behold it qualified for super discount in my size and this color.  I only paid $23!!!!!  I was so happy.  We have about 16 inches of snow and the aggressive sole gives me a lot more confidence on these snow/icy surfaces.  They also give me a little height and keep my pants from dragging the floor.  They are comfortable and I often wear them year round......a little fur in July is OK!"

The shoe is just not snug enough to stay on your foot, you have to walk in a way that will prevent the shoes from flying off. I have had these before and I already knew this but bought another pair anyway. But this will be the last pair for me."

This style is like walking with 2x4's strapped to my feet. Heavy, clunky and not the least bit comfortable. Would not recommend or buy again."
Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,R1KDETIA8QUI60,"December 14, 2018",2,Had to return,"For years I wore the Crocs fuzz-lined Cobbler clogs and I loved them but they stopped selling them.  These looked cute and I got them today but they are going back. Couple reasons.  For one, I always wear a size 8 and it usually fits just fine.  This fits more like a 7.5.  I would have sized up if it wasn't for another problem. First I thought it was because I was already wearing thick socks, so I wore NO socks, but it was still close.  And even though these are furry on the inside, who runs around in the winter with no socks? I don't. There's a little nub of a back on these.  It feels really weird.  It only covers maybe half of an inch of your heel. I changed to thinner socks, and the size was still just BARELY fitting. On top of all of that, if you DO wear no socks, there is a tag seam on the inside that will be really annoying.  Why they did that on a fuzzy shoe I don't know, but it would be very uncomfortable.  Why is there something scratchy on a soft shoe? The sole is quite thick too, which is odd in a clog shoe with no heel.  Your feet isn't being guided into the front of the shoe to keep in inside, so you'd think the sole would be lighter but it isn't.  It's not a huge deal but the heel should have had a lift with such a thick bottom. I returned these."
Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,R11R0101086VCF,"March 1, 2018",1,"I would not recommend, too heavy",i would not recommend this style of sketchers clog as it is much too heavy. After wearing them for just a short time it caused ankle strain and was told to stop wearing them.  I have always worn sketchers and still have my previous pair of clogs however they did not have the same type of sole construction they should have been tossed last year and replaced but i cannot find them any longer as it appears that the company no longer makes them.  Too bad.
Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,RIELPNTKXZ46T,"December 17, 2016",2,Loved these... until I discovered they were leaving big black marks on my floors,"Am updating my original review. I loved these slippers until I started noticing big black marks on my floors. Turned out that the marks were being made by the black rubber soles on these slippers. What kind of poor-quality rubber is that? None of my other rubber-soled shoes leave those kinds of marks. Anyway, despite how comfortable these slippers are, I am going to have to get rid of them, because I don't want to be scrubbing big black marks off my floors every time I wear them. (Original review appears below dotted line.) ------------------------------------------ These were an impulse purchase. I wasn't in the market for slippers, but these showed up in my inbox as an Amazon Deal one day, and the price was great, so I took the bait. I am delighted that I did. I've never had slippers like these, and now I don't know how I did without them all those years. They are luxuriously cozy on the inside and super sturdy on the outside (they're not called Fortress for nothing). So my feet feel pampered and still feel like they can take on anything, such as a chore in the unfinished part of the basement or a trip out to the mailbox on a winter day (which my old suede-bottomed slippers certainly didn't let me do). As other reviewers have noted, they are heavier than the average slipper, but that doesn't bother me; it just adds to the sense of one's feet being very well protected. I wasn't sure what size to buy, as other reviews were all over the map in terms of whether these slippers ran large or small, narrow or wide. I bought them in my regular size, and they fit perfectly with socks; they're a wee bit loose without socks, but it's still not a problem keeping them on. For reference, my feet are on the narrow side."
Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,R2P8M9AI4K5JI,"December 15, 2016",3,"~ Cozy and Warm with Excellent Traction, BUT Definitely a Loose on my Wide Feet ~","These cozy clogs are really warm and soft inside. They are wonderfully comfortable. The little back part always wants to get pushed down under my foot, so I have to push that back up by hand whenever I put them on, which I was hoping to just be able to slide them on and be done. Not a huge deal, just would be nicer without the little back part. I have wide feet and these are quite loose on my feet, even without ""breaking them in."" I would feel safer in them if they fit more snugly. I'm a little afraid I may twist my ankle if I walk on uneven grass or pebbles with them on, so I actually mostly wear these in the morning around the house to keep my feet warm and they do that wonderfully. They're super cozy. They do have wonderful traction, which is perfect for our icy winters, if I do wear them outside. Also, the traction is soft and flexible, so it grips very well. I would not buy these again because they are too loose but, if they were not, I definitely would. Unfortunately, I wore them outside and got them dirty or I would have sent them back, so I will wear them in the house in the mornings, which keeps my feet toasty warm."

This is the 2nd pair I have bought of these Fortress clogs from Amazon.  I bought a pr. for myself, my daughter loved them so much that I ordered her a pair for Christmas.  Both are what I call, ""substantial"" shoes, they are made of genuine, top grade suede, have a cozy faux-fur lining, and have some serious tread on the bottom.  These are called slippers, but we are using them for driving shoes or travel shoes.  Both my daughter and I are extremely happy with these shoes and can hardly wait until they restock so we could get more in different colors.  The company stands behind their product and the seller is tops.  I would definitely recommend these clogs to anyone who likes a great shoe at a great price and excellent customer service.  I intend to buy more when they get other colors in our sizes.  You can't go wrong with these shoes!"
Skechers,Women's Fortress Clog Slipper,B000H0Z82S,RVW92Q062GDD6,"August 19, 2019",5,Excellent Cold Weather Slippers,"After buying a similar pair for my girlfriend I became envious as finding a durable pair of slippers for myself has proven difficult for some time. So after some debate, I decided that I was comfortable enough in my masculinity to order these slippers which themselves are pretty non gender specific in design.  The only downside to this decision was that the fit, as you may imagine, was a bit snug even in the largest size. Fortunately after a short break in period they have stretched enough for me to wear them comfortably. I purchased these because I wanted something to slip on easily when I have to take the dogs out in the middle of the night that would also hold up to our harsh winters. These hit the nail on the head. Reasons I Love these slippers and recommend them for anyone regardless of gender: Durability - After one season of daily use I have not noticed any signs of wear on these slippers. This far exceeds any other pair I have owned. Comfort - I wouldn't want to go hiking in them, but for what one typically wears slippers for, these are surely comfortable enough. Though I will say they are a tad on the heavy side which may be an issue for some. Warmth - The lining on these kept my feet warm in sub freezing temperatures for short stints. Materials - This was the main reason i bought these slippers specifically. The sole are a very thick rubber which helps to keep my feet out of the snow and off of the cold ground. Even better, the exterior is made of suede which, in addition to being durable, has done an excellent job of keeping my feet dry when out in the elements. They may be a little excessive for wearing around the house but they make for an excellent pair of winter slippers to wear if you find yourself making frequent trips outside"

I've since worn them to work and they are comfortable for standing on my feet for 8 hours on mats and concrete. Love not having to worry about tying them in a rush.

Unfortunately they were sold out due to a holiday special sellout so I purchased them here at Amazon. Wearing them for the first time I found them incredibly comfortable and true to size that went on my feet so easily. They hug your feet just right. They're light airy and comfy, with or without socks. It's like walking on a cloud as you walk and they're perfect for seniors who don't have the mobility of lacing their shoes. A must buy by all means."

No support, so not really good for much walking, or for work.  Also the lighter colored pair I bought really showed dirt fast and they are hard to clean very well."

(waitressing) They are not non-slip, but they are supportive and comfortable for being on my feet all day. I wish I would have bought a smaller size. I got my usual size (size 6, wide foot) and these were very big and wide. Buy at least 1/2 size smaller. Updating this after a month of wear - they've stretched out even more. I would not buy again. They don't hold up."

Asia where we did tons of walking. They were the best !  Comfortable, easy on my knees, neutral and went with most casual clothes. Threw them in the wash....easy care. I wanted another pair for another trip where we'll likely do lots of walking.  I can't speak to their comfort/resilience yet - so I gave them middling stars....but these do run REALLY big !  I ordered my usual 6. Huge. I returned them and ordered a 5.5. Still too big.  I returned those and ordered a 5.....and third time's the charm....they actually fit.

I've bought a number of other pairs since, and though none have been quite as amazing as that first pair, they've still been very good.  This pair, however, has no noticeable arch support at all, and they seem too wide as well.  I'll be returning them."

They fit fairly well, just take note that the shoe is a teeny bit wide. Other than that, they are comfortable. There is one very small change that I would make. I would put a small wedge of elastic on both sides of the upper section, so that they are easier to put on and take off."

Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R1ZP5W2YCFFRDQ,"September 19, 2017",1,Disappointment -- too many things wrong with this shoe,"I want to preface this review by saying that I am a HUGE Skechers fan and never have had any trouble with any of their shoes.  This one, however, is an anomaly. I had been looking for a walking shoe that had the comfort of a sneaker, but the  style of a casual dress shoe and based on all the perfect 5-star reviews, I thought this would be it. And it came in wide width too. But sadly, this shoe is awful. Why? Let me list out the reasons: (1) The most annoying part of this shoe is the design. Instead of feeling surefooted and having a wide center of gravity, it constantly felt as though I was walking on platform shoes. If you take a look at the picture, you will see that the sole narrows as it gets to the top and the top part is where your foot is balanced. (2) The left shoe did not feel as though it was made straight. The heel of the shoe tilts towards the inside and the weight of my foot is partially rested  outside the rubber sole. So imagine looking down at your left foot and the top half of your foot with the toes, is inside the shoe, but the bottom half with the heel is askew and off-center. That's exactly how this shoe fit and it makes walking both difficult and uncomfortable. (3) Even though this is a wide fit shoe -- and it does give my foot ample room -- the top part of the opening still cuts into my foot when I walk. It's not due to tightness, but the way the material is made. (4) I was hoping for a sleeker look and this shoe had a very round toe and was chunky making it look more like an orthopedic shoe than something a cool, urban, business woman would wear running errands in NYC. Unfortunately, I've worn this shoe two full days in a row and it is no longer in new condition otherwise I would return it. And without actually walking in it, I would not have known how terrible this shoe is. I will most likely either sell or give this away on Craigslist now."
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R2U3ZY74CBFWGO,"October 29, 2017",5,These are perfect. They are comfy and can be worn with ...,Finally!!!! I have bought and returned almost every pair of Skechers flats in the last couple of months. These are perfect. They are comfy and can be worn with no show flats socks. I've had them a couple weeks now and still love them. If you have wide feet these are great the adjustable strap makes it so it doesn't dig into your feet. But THESE are true to size. Finally a 6 that is a 6!!!
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R2251A2DMQYOCZ,"September 14, 2017",5,HOLY GRAIL OF SHOES!!!,"FINALLY!!! The Holy Grail of shoes for people that have foot issues. It has been impossible for me to find a cute shoe I can wear with dresses that have some padding and a nice slip resistant bottom. I have a wide foot which is so hard to find shoes for and these fit! I am in between a 9 1/2 and a 10 and ordered the 10. It's a little too big but I think if I went down to the 9 1/2 if might be too small. But the shoe is great! It is wide enough, its comfy enough, and cute to wear with dresses! It is almost impossible to find cute wide shoes these days with cushion/support. Thank you, Skechers!!!!"
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R1A4WQ77SA1YEN,"June 11, 2017",1,Expensive price for a cheap shoe,"Size 6 black leather I usually wear 6 or 6-1/2. Always wore 6 in sketchers. Very disappointed with these. I used to wear only Sketchers; they were my go to shoe. I had started wearing Clarks, but thought I'd go back to my Sketchers. This pair was a mistake for sure. The heel has an extremely hard cup- while this ensures the shoes last a long time and hold their shape- on these it also ensures you rub your heels raw on the edges, not just the top but the sides of the heel inside too. This does not look or feel anything like leather. It feels and looks cheap. The did not stretch or soften- at all- after wearing them through several airports. I sincerely thought they would stretch slightly after wearing - they are supposed to be leather after all..... but they certainly do not.  I only wore them for 1 day. They look ruined and trashed. These say 'relaxed fit' but are super tight and rigid. Not relaxed at all. The next size up for me would be too long and I would step out of them but these are uncomfortably snug everywhere but the length. Very disappointed I spent $59 on these."
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R1YCQN0JYNMJ97,"November 19, 2018",5,Great Purchase,I had a pair very similar to these years ago and they were so comfortable.  I've been having issues with my back and slipped on my old pair and it seemed to help but they looked horrible so I bought these as a replacement.  The same day they arrived I was going out of town.  I wore these the whole time and they were so comfortable;  my feet NEVER hurt and my back seemed to get what it needed too.  Plus the Mary-Jane style look very cute and make my feet look smaller that they really are.  What's not to like???
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R16LPTGVOXVR2G,"January 22, 2018",5,"If you do not have wide feet, go at least a half size down","These are VERY comfortable shoes.  I had originally bought my ACTUAL size (8.5) but they did not fit well.  The relaxed fit cause them to be a bit wider and just a tad longer than a typical 8.5 and so the shoe, instead of being snug to my foot, they flopped around as I walked.  I foresaw issues with blisters, particularly on my heels and the sides of my feet and so I reordered in a smaller size.  These fit perfectly....a teeny bit snug in the toe box, but I think that will improve after wearing them for a while. I plan on doing lots of outdoor walking in these (which is why I bought them) and I needed something versatile that could go with jeans, shorts, skirts - even workout pants.  These are perfect. UPDATE: After wearing these shoes for about a week, the toe box is comfortable.  I love these shoes and would definitely purchase them again."
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R3AU44LM1IMONE,"March 10, 2017",4,... material and workmanship of this pair of shoes is good model design,"The material and workmanship of this pair of shoes is good model design, wear comfortable, worthy of praise. The only drawback is that there is a visible trace in front of the right foot (see attached map), leather processing faults, the very famous brands such obvious shortcomings, didn't think of that."
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R3FTNTVPICA67Q,"April 26, 2018",5,So comfortable even with foot problems!,"I have learned with Skechers Mary Janes over the years is that they run a bit large, so when I normally wear and 8.5, I get these in an 8. The show will conform to your foot. I have nerve problems on the ball of my right foot and these shoes are the only ones I can wear and go for long walks in without any pain! I have even ordered a second pair as backup for when the current pair finally die! Love them!"
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R3QHWYVX8Z7CQG,"September 20, 2017",5,Perfect for orthotics!,"They are my new favorite shoes.  They run a bit big, but I am able to put my orthotics in them and they are perfect!  The lining doesn't come out, so I just put my orthotics on top of the existing liners. Dressy enough for what I need them for, but feels like slippers!"
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R15Q7LGTFZKP82,"April 2, 2019",4,Agony...then Comfort!,"This is the 2nd time I've purchased this shoe. My memory not being the best, I guess I must have forgotten about the anguish of breaking these bad-boys in. Your upper toe knuckles will absolutely HATE you for at least the first few wears. The design is so that the opening of the shoe rubs in an ever so abrasive way against the top of your foot where you will want to snatch the shoes off and toss them in a pond. So do not (I repeat, DO NOT) purchase these shoes thinking... ""I'll just put these in my suitcase for my hiking trip"", as I promise you, you will be walking barefoot at the end of that trip! Heed the reviews, there is a design flaw. HOWEVER, if you can get past the rubbing and/or once you break them in, the shoe is super comfy. The insole is very soft and bouncy and as long as you make it through the foot torture, you'll be fine!"
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R39BQRP0H4D81R,"January 2, 2018",5,They finally brought these shoes back in Wide and I am so happy!,"I bought my last pair of these in 2009 and they lasted great! They're a bit stretched out now and I've worn through about 4 different insoles wearing them, but I had no choice. Skechers got rid of this style in wide and I couldn't find any other shoe that fit and wore as well. I even tried these shoes in the ""relaxed fit"" (tighter than wide) that Skechers offered after discontinuing this shoe and they didn't work at all! They were a bit snug and the straps were too short for my high arch--they kept coming unstrapped! Then I finally found these on Amazon and got them, they fit perfectly! Just like that pair I bought in 2009 that I had to wear out completely because I couldn't find a replacement. If you love these shoes, get them ASAP because you never know when they'll be hard to find again!"
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R1W3P5012QRQWN,"September 30, 2019",5,Perfect alternative to sneakers,"Perfect! I have always hated sneakers. I dont have very high arches and ive always found traditional sneakers to be super uncomfortable. In my youth i wore chucks all the time, or vans skate shoes (not the slip ons) but as ive gotten older, ive needed something better and a little nicer looking. I usually wear boots, or sandals if the weather is nice, but on those occasions i need sneakers, for the past several years its been these style mary jane sneaker flats. My last pair is also sketchers but a slightly different style. They have finally started to wear out after over 5 years of near daily wear so i decided to buy a new pair. These. Are. awesome! I work retail and i walk everywhere so my shoes take a beating. Since my last sketchers have lasted me this long (the only problem is the fabric on the inside one of them has come unglued, the actual shoes are fine) i feel confident these will too."
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R2VY6MLKYNT7B8,"June 20, 2018",5,COMING BACK FOR ANOTHER PAIR!!!,"These are even more perfect than I thought they’d be. For some reason in the Mary Janes I take a half size smaller than my usual 10 in my other 20+ pairs of Skechers. These fit perfectly. The straps can be adjusted to fit exactly as you need, on me they do not rub or dig in.  These shoes are for work and when you find something you love, you should buy another to have waiting in the event the originals are worn out."
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R1ZSL97GE9G942,"July 15, 2018",3,Wearing out faster than my last pair,"This is my second pair of these Skechers and they are updated since I last purchased them several years ago. Right away, the memory foam was amazing. However, after a couple months, they have deteriorated a bit. The velcro on the straps is not maintaining well and they become un-velcro-ed almost every time I wear them. Also, I wore them on a long walking trip around Buenos Aires and they developed a hole in the memory foam that now gives me blisters if I wear them for a long time. They are fine for wearing to work, but I can no longer rely on them for long walking days as I could my last pair of Skechers mary janes."
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,RVW3B7A4U1YDS,"October 24, 2018",4,I really do like these shoes.,"Maybe I should've given 5 stars. They fit a little big. I have wide feet and have gained weight, so I figured I would go up a half size. I think my regular size 8 would have been too tight. Is it Skechers' fault I have fat feet? I wore them all day today, and I am up and down on my feet all day long. My feet don't hurt at all. I wore these with leggings and a tunic, and they looked cute, even if they are a tad large for me and have a functional tread that is not very girly looking. There's also not a very thick memory foam sole, but I'm not a shoe designer, so maybe there's something I don't know. I just feel like it could have been a bit thicker and comfier on the inside. The most important thing is that my feet don't hurt today. I know that I will wear these shoes a lot with leggings and casual skirts and dresses, especially if I will be walking a lot that day."
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R3DLAUIRQNQAXG,"December 11, 2019",4,"Almost perfect, but back is too high","I wanted to love these shoes. They’re almost exactly why I wanted, except the back of the shoe. The back of the shoe is about a half inch too high and digs painfully into the back of my ankle when I try to wear them. If the back of the shoe were just a half to an inch shorter, I would wear these everywhere, every day. Aside from that issue, they’re so comfortable and cute. Unfortunately I just can’t deal with the back of the shoe digging into my ankle, so I have to return them. Such a shame, because they’re just about perfect."
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R1I5R1QD2QQX3W,"August 6, 2019",3,Skechers = blisters.... every time!,"I absolutely LOVE the look of Skechers and have bought numerous styles of flats and sneakers. Every single one of them, including these, have left me with such horrid blisters on the back of my heel where they rub. I have tried them with thin no-show socks and even resorted to using bandaids on my heels every time I wear them. Why should I have to? I just love how they look, so cute and stylish and perfect for what I need, but every time I look at them I wince in pain. Really wish these were as comfortable as they are cute, but I'm afraid I will have to give them away."
Skechers,Women's Bikers -Fiesta Mary Jane Flat,B01NCK7LIX,R2UAO0M35T6IY0,"January 8, 2020",5,4th pair in 10 years,"I got my first pair of Skechers Women's BikersMary Jane Flat shoes in 2009. I loved those and they were decorated with bling.  When it was time for a new pair I couldn't find any with bling so I got plain shoes.  Those wore out and I got another pair but I got the wrong size, too small. I wore them for a while and got this pair.  They look like  suede or velvet.  They always fit as I need and comfy.  I can wear them with skirts or dresses and they don't look too bad.  I can't wear high heels as I had a broken foot many decades ago.  THANKS SKETCHERS, DON'T STOP MAKING THESE BIKE SHOES."

Really like the rich brown color. Problematic:  Maybe my instep is lower than average. The strap that criss-crosses over my foot is too long. By the time I pull it tight enough to be secure, (1) the tip of the strap is about 1/8"" from the ground (possibly touching it), and (2) strap barely comes in contact with only half of Velcro strip meant to hold it in place. I often have to refasten during wear. I'll probably take to shoe repair shop to try to resolve the strap-too-long to-fit issue. But the shoe itself, I like just fine. Would buy again, it feels that good."

I usually wear a 10 and my foot is wide, so I got the 10W (naturally).  I wore them one day at work (I only work desk so it wasn't even that much walking) and I had blisters on the back of my heel and on the top side of my foot by the big toe.  I really LOVED the style of them so I sent them back and got an 11.  They seemed smaller than the 10s in those two areas.  Super weird and super disappointed.  Sent back and got something else.  Oh well :/"

I like that the heel is strong enough to slip your foot into the shoe without it collapsing.  It is a very light color but scuffs can be wiped away with a cloth easily.  I would buy again.

They are by far one of the most comfortable shoes I have  ever owned. Toe box just right, moderate arch support, and great color. I have a hard time calling them sneakers because they look more like a casual shoe. This said, like all Sketchers I seem to buy, they are loose in the heel. No matter how thick the socks, my heels come up a bit. I don't think it's a reflection of the shoe. I'm starting to think that my foot isn't proportionate in terms of toe-box and heel. I'm so determined to make them fit that I'm going to do the old ""make your dress shoes fit right"" trick of elevating my heel a bit. I can't recommend them highly enough."

They are very comfy. The tops feel like you’re wearing socks but have some light support. I don’t have any pain from these shoes. The soles are cushioned and flexible. The tops are not water resistant by any means but in 6 years of nursing I only got my previous shoes soiled once on top so I was more concerned with comfort. They slip on very easy and don’t slide around. I’ll buy these again when they eventually wear out."

It's nearly like wearing house slippers outside.  House slippers with arch support. It's nice not having to bother with laces.  Just slip them on and I'm out the door. Hopefully they'll expand the line to include additional colors like maroon, or brown so I can match them with outfits.  I'll definitely purchase another pair in black to keep in the office."

With a pair of thicker socks, they should fit fine. Since I have small feet, it is hard to find the perfect size.

These have a higher arch support and a firmer pad. They felt more like typical gym shoes than comfy cozy slip ons. I have 5 pairs of Skechers and the goga insoles are my favorite. These have memory insoles that feel a bit hard. I'm returning these. They are very nice quality though like all Skechers.

This style curves inward at the top of the heel, which is nice if you are like me and have trouble finding shoes that fit well everywhere else but slide off the heel when walking. But that is what caused the blister. I almost sent them back for a 9, but glad I didn't now, because they have stretched a bit and I am wearing them without a bandaid. So I'm give them 5 stars because they fit fine now, and like all my other pairs, they are the most comfortable shoes ever! :)"

I own 8 different pairs & styles. I do ALOT of Walking & being on My ""precious"" Feet for 10-12 hrs per day, 6 days a week. I wear a Size 9 in most ""Skechers"", but I have 3 separate styles that are a 9W (wide) & a 9.5 (a half size up). I originally ordered these cute shoes in my regular 9 size. But, I sent them back immediately because they were TOO TIGHT in the Width & Length. I wear this style of shoe (slip on) & the Go Walk series, Go Walk Performance & Sport series with NO SOCKS or maybe a ""no show"" sock. Shoot, when these arrived, I tried them on & had a ""hard time"" getting them On & Off. And I wasn't even wearing Socks!! So, I shopped for them here in Asheville North Carolina & found a 9W. I put them on with EASE & was THRILLED that they FIT perfectly...as if they were made for my feet! I had no issues of putting them on or taking them off. And they are VERY COMFORTABLE!! I haven't worn them for 10-12 hrs yet. More like 5 to 6 hours. My feet don't ache or anything like that. I'm very pleased with my purchase at the store. I paid a Lil more there, than on Amazon. But that's ok. I'm giving 5 STARS for this shoe, but in my case, I had to ""change"" / alter the ""shoe size"" just a hair!"

Due to a bunion problem, I need a wider shoe, and these provide that even though they are an 8 1/2 regular instead of wide.  I ordered the navy to go with jeans, and they don't disappoint.  Actually, I have been wearing the taupe even with dress slacks. They are so comfortable that I wear them practically all the time. I am hoping the same for the navy, but so far they fit just like the other pair."

The shoes slip at the heel, so bought stickyback anit slip heel pads to install and will wear with heavier socks.  Will give the other pair to a relative."

I always wear a 7W in my casual shoes and this one fits perfectly. I can easily slip my foot into the shoe when getting ready to go outside. They also do not feel wet on the inside of the shoe when walking through wet grass. They do not make my feet hot in warmer temperatures and are very comfortable for walking. The only negative comment I can make is I really would like to have the Navy pair but they have not been available with Prime for quite some time!

The color pictured is a bit more pink than what they actually are.  They are beige and I could actually get away with wearing them with a casual skirt.  As with any of the Skechers memory foam shoes, they are like walking on a cloud.  I have terrible lower back problems, and wearing just any shoe leaves me in terrible pain at the end of the day.  I do not feel like kicking them off as soon as I walk in the door.  They look great, feel great and I highly recommend.  Might just have to get in other colors too!"

I ordered my size in the C/D size and that is apparently another way to designate a wide fit. The shoes were too big, so I am returning. The same shoe in the B size (which I assume is the regular width) is $20 more expensive, so i’ll have to see if I can find a better deal somewhere else.

It's worse than flip flops. Walking down the long hallway at work were it's extremely quiet and all you can hear is the loud slup thwack, slup thwack, slup thwack, the sound of the suction from the sole label releasing from your heal. I've tried putting tape over the label, foot powder, lotion, walking on my tip toes but still the same sound. I purchased them so I could wear them without socks, but it just won't be possible. Otherwise I own 2 pairs. They are fairly supportive of my high arches and accommodate my wide toe area without pinching while not slipping off my narrow heal."

The sole is now all one piece and no longer flexible. The toe box is very narrow and compresses my toes. The area around the balls of my feet also feels too tight, and I have narrow feet! The shoe somehow forces me to put too much weight on the balls of my feet. The entire shoe is somehow ill fitting, the material puckers and ballooons outward when walking, looks really awkward. Very disappointing all over. I will go back to purchasing the Go Walk 3s for as long as I can."

Comfortable right out of the box!,"Who knew Skechers could improve on the GO 3 series?  The GO Walk 4 shoes are even better because they provide greater stability and might just wear longer than the 3 series shoes (of which I have about 14 pairs).  I now have three pairs of the 4 series and am impressed.  All day comfort right out of the box and even more cushion than the 3s.  The biggest difference is in the fabric (it's not the soft knit like some of the 3s) and that they are slightly more narrow than the Fitknit 3s with less room in the toe box.  The 4s fit more like a regular shoe than the loose-fitting comfort of the 3s.  Some people have had questions about how the heels fit in these shoes.  The 4s do not have the extra heel padding at the back of the shoe like the 3s do, so the heels are not as wide.  I've added some pics to this review to show the difference.  The three pairs I have (the dark grey/purple, the blue/green flowers, and the taupe/pink) are great for work, but I do hope that Skechers comes out with some wild colors and patterns for this iteration...  I'd go crazy for a tie dyed pattern or multi-color Fitknit version!"

I also like the style and the variety of colors these shoes come in. I gave these shoes 3 stars because I have been buying/wearing Skechers Go Walk for a few years now and the all seem to have the same problem. The soles and the inside of these shoes wear out too fast. I walk for about 30-40 minutes, almost every day and after about 2 months of wear, the soles are almost completely worn out and the shoes have holes on the inside."

They are a little bit big, not so big I can't wear them but a little looser than I'd like. I've gotten used to it - it bothered me in the beginning but the shoes just feel natural and comfy now. If you are in between sizes, probably go to the lower size, but really it's not a huge deal. They are cute, they slip on easily, and are super comfortable. I don't have a car so I walk everywhere and I wear these to walk to my friends' houses, to get groceries, catch the bus, etc. I've walked a couple miles at a time in them with no complaints. I love them so much, I bought them in another color to have more options. I got them for a trip to London and they were the perfect shoe for walking around the city all day."

I wore these every day for 3 weeks on a European tour and my feet never tired! I biked in wet and dry conditions with no foot slips or issues on the peddles. Walked In the rain and dry weather. Hiked rocky, gravely, muddy, dry dirt, all terrain with no issues. Does not have great ankle support so not recommended for major hiking, but light hiking is ok. Also didn't offer the best traction on slick, smooth rocks. Stayed super comfy! Never experienced shin splits or foot/leg problems. Did seem a tad large, but thicker socks helped the issue."

I would prefer a removable insole so it could be laundered by itelf, or replaced with an orthotic insole."

I have never, repeat NEVER found a shoe more comfortable than these. And this Limited Edition version for breast cancer is so cute. It has the little ribbon on the back and all through the shoe. There is no ""breaking in"" period. I just put them on and go! I bought these for a sightseeing trip to Paris and I know I'll be super comfortable the whole time. This is my third pair of Sketchers and I cannot live without them!"
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 4 Kindle Slip-On Walking Shoe,B01LXF52ZA,R1HIGHK9HIFPO1,"January 9, 2018",4,About a half size too large,"Overall I like these shoes.  I've been wearing Go Walks for a few years now and each pair lasts about a year before they become uncomfortable due to the sole wearing thin.  I have very flat feet and plantar fasciitis and these Go Walk 4s were super comfortable from the moment I put them.  However, I was very surprised to find that my normal 7.5 was actually too big, my heel slips out a bit.  This is the first pair of Skechers I've bought that were too big for me and I had read the reviews before purchasing saying that they ran a little small.  That was not my experience, they ran a little big for me.  Oh well, I will double up the weight of my socks or put an extra insole in them and use them for working around the house.  I just ordered an additional pair in a half size smaller (7) and we'll see how it goes!"
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 4 Kindle Slip-On Walking Shoe,B01LXF52ZA,R1WTX5O0QT8LPL,"September 27, 2017",3,"Mixed Reviews for Now, but Exchanging Sizes--Update Added","Despite some reviews detailing exactly the degree to which these are a little short in length and a bit narrow from the mid-foot through the toe, it seemed that most reviewers commenting on size said the shoes were on the too big side. I also consulted the fit advisor link. After I answered the questions, it recommended size 9-1/2 C/D (wide). I did more sleuthing on width advice at the Skechers website and found that although these gowalk 4 Kindles seemed to fall into Skechers' regular ( narrowest) category, my feet fell into the B/C (medium) category even in that somewhat narrow shoe. Since I had also ordered a gowalk 3 Slipon in 9B and felt that it looked right,  had no width issues, and seemed to have no length issues, I ordered the size 9 B in the gowalk 4. Big mistake. My right foot looked elegant and felt fine; my left foot felt that the toe box was short and the mid-foot to end area felt too confining. My husband said they seemed a bit snug. They did leave an indentation on the arch at the top of my foot. Then I checked the size marked on the inside. The little equivalence chart said US 9, UK 6, EU 39. This was true of both gowalk 3 & 4. I do not fit an EU 39. It may look good, but my toes get tired af bumping into the end. I usually buy dressy EU shoes in size 40, partly because the toes are more pointy as well as the shoes not being available in half-sizes. Some well made non-extreme shoes are safe in 39-1/2. Bottom line, I'm returning the gowalk 4 size US 9B and getting a 9-1/2 B. Here's hoping that does the trick. Side note: Based on the fit of my grey gowalk 3, I purchased a second pair in all black size 9. The comfy shoe look morphed into gunboats because of the black upper and sole combo. Not sleek like the black/pink gowalk 4, which didn't fit but I almost liked. I also reconsidered the fit of the gowalk 3. I decided that the size 9 left foot was truly a tad short but I could feel comfy because of the added width. I'm returning the all black gowalk 3 size 9 pair. The 9-1/2B gowalk 4 kindle mentioned above will be in all black. Here's hoping the new size and color will fix both the size and gunboat problems. Update as promised: the 9-1/2 Gowalk 4 shoes were too roomy. I tried them on my big foot (left), and the shoe seemed a bit long as well as wide in the toe box. The worst problem was the heel. My foot kept slipping out the back. True. It was a half size bigger than the one that felt too small. Another reviewer reported that the heel padding that the Gowalk 3 had but 4 didn’t made the heel fit better. I found the opposite. The padding on the Gowalk 3 heel was essential to keeping the shoes on my feet and gave my foot a cradled, secure feeling. These gunboats didn’t seem like gunboats any more. I think you’ll like the Gowalk 4 if you have medium feet on the narrower side (B width) and like a sleeker,  more “normal” fit. Mine are on the wider side but not quite C width. (The Skechers website includes both as medium width). I find the sleeker look doesn’t fit or flatter my feet."

I seem to be between sizes in the Go Walk 4s. My last two were both 11s, which were perfect and got worn into the ground. I originally bought the 11s in these, which proved to be too large, and went back and bought the 10.5s, which proved to be too small. In the end, I was forced to choose the lesser of two evils, which was the bigger size. I've had them for several months now, and I can't wear them during the day as long as I wore the previous versions, because after awhile they start to make my feet and legs hurt. Not sure what they changed between the 3s and the 4s, but whatever it was, it seems to be for the worse."

Less casual looking but with all the comfort of a sneaker.  They are light as a feather, cushioned inside and out, and can be tossed in the washer without shrinking or curling.  Seriously the best walking shoe ever!  That being said, Beware: the manufacturer is now offering a similar style touting ""memory foam"" that is not at all comfortable. And the Go Walk line seems to be shrinking or phasing out. So be sure that you are getting the ""Go Walk"".  Manufacturer take note:  DO NOT MESS with my Go Walks!"

These are so comfortable.  These have a comfortable foam insert that seems to cushion my feet. I can stand in them all day and walk several miles in them without any problems.  I even wear them to dinners and concerts (my black pair), hoping that it is too dark to see what I have on my feet.  I only wish that they could make something a little dressier, but I'm willing to put up with some ""ribbing"" (so far haven't gotten any) just so that my feet are happy.  They do seem to stretch out a little over time, but it doesn't bother me too much."

The first pair, purchased years ago, seemed to last for six months. I replaced those with a second pair that seemed to wear out in half the time. I swore that I would not purchase another pair.  However, I liked how they felt when I walk my 3.5 miles, four times a week, so on January 30, 2019, I slipped on this pair and started walking.  In a month, these ""walking Sketchers"" are wearing down, in what I feel is an unacceptable period of time. There has to be a better durable material to make the soles from....too bad - I like they way they feel, but I don't want to replace them every two - three months."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 4 Kindle Slip-On Walking Shoe,B01LXF52ZA,R3CGSLUK2WO98A,"October 26, 2018",3,Huge,"This is my third pair, so  I did not expect it to run a size large this time. I am keeping them because I threw away the box already--confident they'd fit because this is pair three.  Thankfully I have some inserts that I can use that keep them on my feet.  Disappointing, because I thought I had found the perfect shoe! They wear out quickly but while they are good they are the best. Adding this a few days later: I have come to the conclusion that these are cheap knock offs. Pay slightly more and get the real deal--side by side with the pair I bought previously, these are very different.  Fabric is more shiny and plastic and size is way off. They are however wearable and I shall use them.  The real version is the most comfortable in the world, so I do recommend that you try them!"

These didn't fit quite as well as the Beach ones. I think it's because the Beach ones have a slight gather, so they stay on better. These feel a little loose. I'm just going to put a heel insert in so they stay on better since they are super cute. I love that they don't have a huge white toe cap like a lot of other shoes. This one is a little more subtle. I also love the material and the rose gold looking accents."

Although they run slightly large, I ordered my size 9 1/2 and they seem to fit okay.  The toe box is larger, which works well for me.  The bottoms have a picture etched in them, which is really cool looking.  They seem fairly comfortable.  I bought 36 inch white shoe laces and replaced the little ones that came with the shoes."

They exceeded my expectations as they were instantly comfortable! I did a lot of walking each day and had no issues or discomfort which was a lifesaver since this was the only pair of sneakers I took. They also are very stylish and can even be worn with dresses. I'm so happy I bought these and will definitely look into another color.

I was excited to read the reviews that these were a little big in the toe box (and they absolutely are) b/c I need and like a little extra room in that area. I bought the shoe in my normal size, and still have a little extra breathing room. I prefer to not wear sock with my slip on shoes, but with these I kinda need a thin sock for them to fit well. I would recommend most people to order a half size down, but those with a wider foot, give your normal shoe size a go. These shoes are also super cute (I love the rose gold detail), well constructed, and very comfortable."

I finally decided to get these over the roxy pair because these were on sale. I'm glad that I did. They are very comfortable and have a memory foam sole. They also have elastic on the inside of the tongue of the shoe making it easy to slip them on and off. They seem to stay on my feet well with zero slipping in the heel, which I have read was an issue with a similar brand. They are cute, comfortable,  quick to put on, and fit true to size. What more can a girl ask for from a shoe."

I did feel some slipping like other reviewers said when I didn't wear socks  with them but it wasn't that bad. If I would of bought them in any different of a size they wouldn't of fit so I'm glad I stuck with my original size. These are one of the most comfortable shoes I own. They have memory foam and they are so soft. I like that you can wear them with or without socks as well and they didn't leave any blisters on my heel. I would recommend these shoes and I will be purchasing more in different colors. My new favorite pair of shoes.

It feels like you're walking on a cloud. I know people say that the memory foam like sole will deflate, but that is a non issue for casual daily wear like what I imagine they're designed for and how I intend to wear them. Inside, the material is softer and more forgiving than typical sneakers of this style and the elastic band really helps hold them to your foot.  Also, these are the first sneaker I've owned that genuinely do not need breaking in. I range between sizes 9-9.5 and chose a 9 which fits nicely. I highly recommend and will be buying more colors."

My foot is small and wide.  Very difficult to find shoes.  I have tried some expensive ones that had more padding than these but just didn't fit.  I will put an insole in for more padding.

They do have some cushion in the heel and mid-foot, but declines toward the ball of foot. I had to add a Dr. Scholls cushion insert to be able to wear them all day.

Skechers,Sport Men's Equalizer Coast to Coast Mule,B01APLBZIY,RQ0OMGGPIY2V7,"January 7, 2018",5,OUTSTANDING HOUSE SLIPPERS!,I received these slippers 3 days ago and I have worn them the majority of time for the last three days. I found them to be perfect indoor house slippers especially in colder weather. They have a good rubber bottom outer sole that does not slip on tile and wooden floors like most other plastic bottomed house slippers do. The memory foam insert is outstanding and it makes these step in slippers very comfortable indoors. They are easy to step in and out of.   But....based on my use outdoors several times they are not suitable for me outdoors because they cannot match the support of my New Balance 928 hook and strap walkers. They are also not warm in freezing cold outdoor weather. A warmer climate might be different. I never tried to run in them. Just walking in them with or without socks was easy and my feet did not slip out. I wear a size 12 1/2 D.  They arrived true to size. The material around the top of the shoe is fabric not leather.   Great indoors house slippers but not for longer outdoor wear for me.

I live in them around the house, and even for quick trips to the store.  Fantastic product.  VERY comfortable.  I suffer from Neuropathy, and tight shoes and/ore socks exacerbate the painful, tingling sensation in my feet.  These shoes allow me to kick them off for periods of time, then easily slide into them again (shoe horns not needed, as with other shoes).  I'll never be without a pair of these shoes!"

These shoes seemed like a quality item. I put them away for about 3 weeks until the weather then wore them for most of the day. As the day went on i noticed 1 shoe was feeling looser than the other. Upon inspection i saw the elastic had come apart on both sides of the shoe. The other shoe was fine. It is not likely i will buy any more Sketchers. An maybe no more shoes from Amazon i initially liked these shoes but the quality doesn't seem to be there. I am very dissapointed.

I compared these in length to my other sketchers and they are longer. I ordered an 11 which is my size in Sketchers but probably should have sent them back for a 10.5. Despite being a tad loose and roomy, they work fine for my needs. No break in is needed with these. They are well made and comfortable as soon as you put them on. They are very light and well constructed for durability. I would have given 5 stars if the size was true. You will absolutely love these in a half size smaller."
Skechers,Sport Men's Equalizer Coast to Coast Mule,B01APLBZIY,R3RASCZSO332SK,"March 3, 2019",3,A little disapointed with these Skechers Sport Men's Equalizer Coast to Coast Mule,"In the past, I've owned a pair of the Skechers Sport Men's Equalizer Coast to Coast Mule slip-on tennis shoes.  I wore them for years before I got rid of them.  When I did get rid of them, I was sad because I could not find them anywhere at physical tennis shoes department stores, nor did the vendor have any idea on what I was talking about.  Since I have physical disabilities today that make tying my shoe laces a challenge, I really loved these tennis shoes, and again, not being able to find them truly did make me sad. When I found them again via Amazon.com, I was happy and excited and immediately ordered a pair.  I was expecting the same dimensions, quality, and comfort that I remembered my old pair giving me for years.  Once I received them, I was sort of disappointed because they feel inferior to my original pair that I owned.  The material just went from what I remember being cotton to it being some sort of nylon, the padding on the shoe was okay but felt much softer than the original pair. The softness doesn't help either, when one is 285 lbs.  If I can compare it to anything, I would say it's like stepping on your average sponge. Also, the biggest disappointment for me was that these new tennis shoes are made narrower than the original pair that I owned.  I can actually feel the edges of the tennis shoes sole just a bit on the inside of my feet's soles.  That part is concerning to me because I was planning on using them at the gym, but if they are the way they are now, I have a feeling that they are going to cause blisters on my feet.  We'll just have to try them out and see how they handle. The arch is also a bit too tight on my foot. I really think that Sketchers is cutting material in order to maximize profits here.  But who knows.  These days nothing surprises me no more.  The bad thing is that at the end, the consumer is the one that is left holding these products. I will follow up more on these Skechers Sport Men's Equalizer Coast to Coast Mule tennis shoes."

I use these as 'slippers' or shoes to wear around my house.  They are versatile enough that you could get mail in them OR go to the store. However, I try to minimize wear & tear by wearing them in-home only.  I paid about $49 for the pair & would definitely buy again. The memory foam really holds up well & expands out between wearing them (however I'm not sure if this would be true if you wore these on a more regular basis).  The arch support is perfect.

I usually wear a wide size, so I was concerned that these would be too tight since there was no wide size to be had.  However they are working out.

Skechers,Sport Men's Equalizer Coast to Coast Mule,B01APLBZIY,RUB96W1ISKOMU,"June 9, 2018",4,Loving my new Skechers!,I actually own eight pair of Skechers now. Four of the shoes (including this pair) were about a half size smaller than I normally would like. When I wear these without any socks they fit alright. I will always love the brand due to the unbelievable comfort they give my feet.
Skechers,Sport Men's Equalizer Coast to Coast Mule,B01APLBZIY,RYLUV7JZQ1FM8,"December 18, 2019",5,Comfortable,I got this because I have diabetes and high blood pressure. I wear diabetic socks and its important that I wear loose shoes as well. If I don't my feet swell and ache. This shoes feel really good and the appearance is decent (what I was looking for). Very happy with these and will purchase again.
Skechers,Sport Men's Equalizer Coast to Coast Mule,B01APLBZIY,R5F5B4JGHA8L5,"October 17, 2018",3,Memory Foam Lost Its Memory,"Exceptionally comfortable when new. The shoes are now 8 months old and the memory foam sole is flatter than a pancake which indicates the “memory foam” is not like the memory foam used as a bed topper (10+ years). Price increase of 30% since original purchase stops me from reordering considering their short life span. On the other hand, if you have lots of bucks to spend on shoe replacement every 6-8 months go for it."
Skechers,Sport Men's Equalizer Coast to Coast Mule,B01APLBZIY,R36KYB4N2H8P4Q,"August 8, 2017",5,Great & Comfortable Fit,"I purchased these for my extremely picky father, completely unsure if he'd like them at all. I was pleasantly surprised that he actually LOVES them! My father has wide feet and was worried these would be uncomfortable since they didn't come in wide, however they fit perfectly with plenty of room for his wide feet. I myself have been a Skechers fan for years now, and I believe I've now converted my Dad. If a man as picky and set in his ways approves of these Skechers then I highly recommend them to other men."
Skechers,Sport Men's Equalizer Coast to Coast Mule,B01APLBZIY,R1MKULVZIIQPLT,"March 12, 2019",5,Sketcher To The Rescue,"Due to swelling in my feet, I needed a shoe I could get my feet into.  This Sketcher low back was a perfect choice. I purchased a size larger than normal and the low back allowed my feet to easily slide right in and there was no problem keeping the shoes from falling off.  This shoe was a far better option than flip flops.  Great shoe - Great price."
Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,R18JM639TL9ITB,"June 16, 2019",5,These were purchased based off reviews,"I was looking for something that was very comfortable. I work on my feet all day and was really feeling it in my lower back, my feet and ankles were so sore. I was going to go with a much more expensive brand and figured these were half the cost, so I'd tried them. First. they fit like I expected, not to tight not too big. They are such a supportive shoe, they are also so crazy comfortable. I think I will buy more, just in different colours. The overall look of the shoe is very appealing the navy sets off the pink and also prevents the shoe from looking dirty. They are airy and your feet aren't stinky even after wearing them all day."
Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,RFVD9W6K802D,"May 6, 2019",5,Great shoes for a great price.,These shoes were so comfortable right out of the box.  I am a nurse and on my feet all day.  Love these shoes.  Will be ordering a second pair for sure.

Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,R2BAXW4C3I9A10,"June 6, 2019",3,"Narrow width, size up!","Very lightweight and mostly comfortable, but the toe box was too narrow/tight to accommodate my bunions.  The upper fabric is stretchy with little support.  I ended up purchasing the Skechers Evolution Ultra, sizing up from my regular 8.5 to a 9, with socks."
Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,RB1FGWP4H9VIY,"June 13, 2019",5,Great walking sneakers,"Just did a fundraiser and walked 13 miles in these shoes. They were wonderful. Feet hurt a bit after 9ish miles but not because of sneakers. Comfortable, good support. Would definitely recommend."
Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,R3RS8AJPRZ7U2S,"May 27, 2019",5,Get these,"These arrived fast and fit my size 11 feet perfectly. They are so comfortable and I immediately ordered another pair. The only thing I don’t care for is how sneakers have all gone to using mesh material (instead of leather) which breaks down much faster. So not sure how long these will last. However, at least the price is reasonable. Wore to the gym and never even thought about them being on my feet which means they were super comfortable!"
Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,R3BMOWCGOTR6WC,"June 1, 2019",5,Survived Disney World,"I wore these shoes at Disney World for 4 days and they were great. Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to break them in a lot before we went, but no issues. We got rained on several days and these shoes got soaked. The good news is they dried quickly and were ready to wear the next day."

Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,R35GURKU28SEY9,"July 12, 2019",3,"The most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever owned, with an Update","These are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned. I work on a concrete floor for 8 hours a day. When I wear other sneakers my feet are sore at the end of the day. With these Skechers, so far my feet aren’t sore. I also do a lot of walking for exercise. I usually walk 5 to 6 miles at a time and, again, my feet feel great. I highly recommend these sneakers. Update: These Skechers are extremely comfortable right up until they are worn down. In my case, it took about two and a half months. I’m very hard on my sneakers. And while these Skechers didn’t last too long, I’m still going to order them again because they are still the most comfortable sneakers on the market. They really do make a huge difference on how I feel after a hard days work."

Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,R1ZXXF0YLM3AJO,"January 6, 2020",5,Great Walking Shoe,"I went on a 3 mile walk in these straight out of the box and they were great.  No pinching, no rubbing, and decent sole cushioning.  I have a narrow foot and these fit nicely without having to cinch up the laces so if you have an overly wide foot they might not be for you.  Overall, great walking shoe for $40!"
Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,R2S89L2YNJXYA0,"August 10, 2019",5,So Comfortable,"I did not believe these would be as comfortable as the Go Walk 3 and 4 Skechers. But I really liked the color and look of them so I thought I would try them. And I surprised to say that somehow they are even more comfortable. Don't know how Skechers managed that without those circular pads, but they did."
Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,R2J1DKSS7MM1CD,"June 11, 2019",1,Too small,Runs very small.  Pretty shoe but I wear an 8 and in this I would need a 9.
Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,R59R8L7VSKJHD,"November 15, 2019",5,Finally a comfortable pair of shoes right out of the box.,I was looking for a light weight shoe with support. I cannot wear just any shoe. Most shoes I have had for 20 years I have had to add additional support. Not these shoes. I put them on took my daily 2 1/2 mile walk. Then went shopping and running errands. These shoes are super comfortable. I definitely will be purchasing again.
Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,R3V8B2ZCUZOH0T,"January 7, 2020",5,So Comfortable!,Normally wear a size 9 but sized up to a 9 1/2. I wore these shoes for 3 days at Disneyland with no blisters or problems (& my feet inherently have issues) . They were a last minute purchase that i definitely did not regret!

Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,R3QV6XJHUDSUAM,"December 3, 2019",4,Really comfortable,SUPER comfortable but just not my taste style wise.  I thought they were ugly so I returned them for a different style of sketchers with the same sole / cushioning.
Skechers,Women's Go Walk Joy-15641 Sneaker,B07FKW9KWX,R2GYJWLVBCW4HK,"January 15, 2020",5,Perfect Fit!,"I'm now wearing these new Stretchers 15641 sneaker and they fit perfect and walk so very comfortably! And I already have bad feet, so this is so nice to find."

Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R6BUN6BQ732GN,"December 17, 2017",5,I love these shoes,"I love these shoes!!!  The GOGA Max insole is amazing!  This is my second pair!  I have tried wearing the memory foam ones and within the first month....they are completely flat!  No rebound left.  I am a nurse and am on my feet all day.  I also have a ""bad"" knee.  Wearing these shoes, my knee doesn't hurt and my feet don't hurt.  Skechers have always been my favorite gymshoe, but as long as they continue to make thse shoes with the GOGA insole....I will never buy a different pair.  I have recommended these shoes to a few of my coworkers and the ones that have bought them, love them too!  They are very lightweight and breathable.  I do recommend spraying them with some sort of sealant if you don't want your feet wet when it rains.  I spray mine with ""camp dry"" and it works great!  Even after being sprayed with a sealant, they are still breathable."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,RY34DDN25FR7E,"March 19, 2017",5,Sleek and stylish.,"I love that they don't have that bulky athletic shoe look!  They are sleek and slim and comfy.  I'm a skechers fan, and I ordered these in my usual size and found they are true to size."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R1ERB3AIIP3GVR,"March 18, 2017",5,Lightweight & cool,The sneakers are perfect for what I needed. I travel & do a lot of walking through airports. These provide the support I need but are super light. This makes them very comfortable in the long stretch & keep my feet cooler than traditionally heavy sneakers
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R2FFYY53NDCYWF,"July 10, 2017",4,Very nice shoe. Very comfortable,"Very nice shoe. Very comfortable. I wear a 6.5 normally and the 6.5 in this show fit perfect. Only thing I didn't realize was that the laces don't tie. They are stretch fit, slip on. I didn't know this when purchasing, but I'm not overly upset about it."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R194H0GU7EPDTO,"June 14, 2017",4,Faux stretch laces too tight,"The black with white soles and black and white laces is super cute.  I bought half size up as I usually do in athletic shoes and it fits a hair roomy in the length and perfect B in the width.  Be aware if you have high arches or a thick bridge of foot, the tongue is sewn in so the stretchy faux laces are limited how much they can stretch.  The height through the arch area is not generous and I knew as the day wore on and feet swelled, I would be feeling pressure.  When the the tongue is sewn in, you can't make it work by replacing the stretch laces with real laces."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R2X8K4KBV2HOFR,"January 12, 2018",5,"Very cushioning, and looks dressy as a shoe.","Really nice looking and fits me great. I wanted black, comfortable shoes to wear with black pants for performing. I need to be able to stand for a while, and my feet began hurting me, which was very distracting. These shoes are very cushy, with a lot of give under your feet. I liked that the entire shoe looked dressy, without having markings on it which stood out and made it obvious that this was a brand of tennis shoes. But the important thing is that my feet no longer hurt."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,RNDCDR7OGPILN,"January 7, 2018",5,Comfortable and Stylish,"Shoe true to size, I normally wear an 8 1/2. I wore these shoes on my three-week-honeymoon in Europe. The shoes were absolutely perfect. They (1) went with a variety of outfits, (2) are breathable/lightweight, and (3) most importantly were incredibly comfortable. I wore these shoes to hike, to walk around on the cobble stoned streets of Rome, and yes with a dress to bars."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R3BPYIITLK4PJV,"May 11, 2017",5,These are ridiculously comfortable. They are light as a feather,"These are ridiculously comfortable. They are light as a feather, and the kooshy insoles are easy on the feet. The outer knit fabric is breathable and flexible. I purchased these and proceeded to put them through the wringer walking at Disney World. No blisters, no pain (aside from just tired feet, but that's to be expected at Disney World)."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,RQRPKKKMIZQJR,"April 23, 2017",5,but the comfort level feels good. I really hate those clunky thick sneakers,"This feels a little small, given that I usually wear a 9 and ordered a 9.5. But these shoes are very lightweight and the footbed is cushy without feeling sloppy, if you know what I mean. The top stretches a bit and give some wiggle room for my toes. I bought these to wear to a garden center job (on feet for hours at a time in a sometimes wet environment). Will see how they hold up, but the comfort level feels good. I really hate those clunky thick sneakers, so pleased that these are light and cushy."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R3SAWWVK09STK5,"August 1, 2017",1,Buyer beware,Beware!! I paid $32 for these shoes. They are not true to size....too small. I. returned them and only received $18 back. I was charged $8.95 for restocking fee and $4.95 for shipping charges.  Plus the shoes seemed inferior in quality.
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R1NU551FNDJBF7,"January 11, 2018",5,5 stars from me.,"I am not a fan of sports shoes in the traditional sense, and am v confused and bewildered at the direction they seem to have been taking, design-wise, the past years. All I ever wanted was a comfortable, low-key shoe with nice lines, ya know? Well, Sketchers has delivered. These shoes are everything. I got the ""charcoal on black"" (or vice versa) in size 8 and I am here to tell you, they are fantastic. They fit true to size (I never know what to think when people say that, but I wear size 8 or 8.5 normally, and these fit perfectly. There's that.), and they have a lovely memory foam bed and a super light design. They feel like floating. Like walking on clouds. To be fair, I have a desk job but I am on my feet quite a bit every day. I have no complaints. I plan on revisiting this shop quite a bit, you know that when you find a good thing you shouldn't let it get away! And, they have so, so many colors to choose from. Go. Do it."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,RAVLRPIYWFUAQ,"June 11, 2019",5,"Very comfortable, order a half size up.","I searched high and low for new sketchers similar to the ones I bought at a store a year ago. While every pair I found had the memory foam, they had what I would describe as a lip all around the edge, meaning the tips of your toes curve a little over it cause the foam does not fill out the entire shoe. Could just be my own personal annoyance, but I can’t stand that. Finally found these online that had the same sole as the ones I was wearing. (Performance fit I think?) While they are comfortable, they’re sadly for me not as comfortable as my old ones when I bought them. I think the foam is thinner, but that’s ok. I NEEDED a new pair. I am a server and bartender in the thick of a busy patio season, and that concrete patio is killer on the feet. While yes I do recommend them (I converted a lot of coworkers to switch to sketchers) my right heel does hurt by the end of the shift. But hey, what do you expect when you’re walking non stop for 8+ hours? (Take care of your servers, people!)  I wear a 7.5 but got an 8 and they got perfect."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R3E5H52BERCVXZ,"February 15, 2019",5,Extremely comfortable shoe,"Things I like: 1. Very comfortable. There is an appropriate amount of toe-wiggle room while the shoe does not ""slip around."" 2. The slip on is nice. They don't slip on like a pair of flats, but they slip on (once a bit ""broken in"") with a little help. 3. They don't look like I'm wearing gun boats on my feet. They are ""trim"" and - since I bought the black ones - not glaringly childish looking so I can wear them for errands or to meet a fried for lunch without looking like I am on my way to the gym. Cons 1. They run a bit small. Not a lot, but a bit. I bought a half size up and they fit fine. Good product for everyday wear. Highly recommend."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R3BMXUCKJ8NGWH,"May 10, 2017",3,I can wear them for short times and they are comfortable but then my wide foot begins to feel the ...,"These are a bit more narrow than I was expecting. I can wear them for short times and they are comfortable but then my wide foot begins to feel the pressure. I like the color, and they are well made and if they were a bit wider through the top of my foot they would be wonderful. I will still wear them for short time uses."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R84IU416D2HPX,"April 19, 2019",2,Buy these if you want STINKY FEET,"These are the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever worn. Unfortunately, after less than a month, the shoes STINK. I mean, they stink like you’ve been in the desert sweating like an animal that ate a bag of onions and cheese and a few sacs of hamburgers from White Castle. The smell is also impossible to get rid of. I have never had this problem with any other sneaker/shoe and am a clean person who showers daily. Google “Sketchers smelly feet,” and you’ll see complaints from many, many people going back to 2009 to the present. Many think it’s the memory foam or some material (glue) Sketchers uses in manufacturing. I’m sad because I’m throwing these out after wearing them for less than a month. It’s a real bummer because truly are comfortable!"
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R11RT8LSQ8IEBW,"April 25, 2017",5,Exactly what I was hoping for!,"Simply outstanding!  These shoes are super lightweight, breathable and so comfortable.  The insoles have a springy or bouncy feel - like a yoga mat.  The knit outside has a heathered texture.  I love the feel of these - perfect for casual everyday wear and walking.  I also really like the style - they just look simple, modern, fresh - very happy and considering buying in another color.  Highly Recommended!"
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R2RGBCD6UHBK6M,"May 2, 2017",4,Satisfied,"Shoes are somewhat thin in width,so get wide if you have a wider fit.Size is exact but if you like room size up.All in all I'm satisfied."

I put them on and headed to New York City.  I know you should never wear new shoes, but, these felt broken in already.  So light and comfy.  My feet never hurt and they were great with a light weight sock.  I'm ordering another pair in heather gray.  My first pair were the navy heather and they look great with skinny jeans and ankle jeans because they are so slim.  Great find and price."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,RCWD7XD7EF9KG,"August 22, 2017",5,A great choice for comfy feet all day!,"These are SOOOO comfortable! I love them. I wore them literally all day yesterday - from 7 am until 10 pm - and my feet never felt fatigued. The memory foam insole is especially great. They're incredibly light, and the knit fabric fits nicely around your foot. I WILL warn, however, that the sole is not super durable. When I got home last night, I noticed that a small chunk had ripped out of it, which I think came from walking on gravel. So beware wearing them on a rough surface - but otherwise no complaints at all. They're one of my fave pairs of shoes."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Agile Walking Shoe,B01IPYZ03O,R1MKDDEKAYK1DT,"May 23, 2017",3,cute shoes but difficult to put on,"I bought these for my daughter because she thought they were really cute. I went through the reviews and they were all positive. I don't know if it's the shape of my daughter's foot or the shape of the shoe but it just does not fit. The length of the shoe is fine but she has problems putting the shoes on. Even after she unties the laces and loosens the tongue, the shoes don't slip on but require a lot of effort, wriggling squirming, etc. We have ended up using a shoe horn to put these on. Once they're on' they're fine and comfortable. She does not have these issues with other sneakers."
Skechers,Women's Go Walk Smart-16700 Sneaker,B07N12X88P,R2IMZTYNEYL284,"December 16, 2019",4,Need more stretch,These shoes are comfortable once you get them on but there is no stretch whatsoever. It’s a bit of a chore to shove my foot in and pull up the heel because the top doesn’t stretch or give at all. But once on they are comfortable to walk in so that’s what important.

Very slight arch support but it doesn't bother me.  The one negative I do have is that the sizing is a bit off for me.  Size 7 is my regular shoe size and so I have to wear thicker pair of socks when wearing them.  I think size 6 1/2 will be too snug so didn't want to chance it."

I especially like it for just around the house. But I’m sure it will be great for walking when the snow disappears.

I have been looking for the perfect ‘teacher shoe’, and this is it! My only wish is that there were some air holes or something to keep your feet cooler. My grade is a 99% A!"
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R2U93LH81S0XOV,"July 6, 2019",1,Great shoes for the first hour or so!,"The shoes are true to size, light and very comfortable. I purchased them to wear around the yard, as i spend a significant amount outside working. The reason for the one star is the material of the insole. The memory foam is too porous and after only a few hours the shoes smelled terrible. I have never had that problem with any other shoe. They smelled actually so bad that i could not keep them in the house - they went in the trash after only two days. Minor research on google confirmed this issue with sketchers memory foam shoes. Total waste of my money."
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R1MYXNUV2E3Y62,"July 31, 2017",5,So comfy,Let's be real. If you work on your feet for any length of time your feet are going to get messed up. I have one foot that's bigger than the other. Primarily this is due to a bunion. These shoes are so comfortable. No pain.
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,RPTUW79GM8ER9,"January 28, 2019",5,A comfortable shoe.,"I love my shoes! Perfect fit for me. These shoes are so light weight and comfortable, yet have good support. The memory foam adds extra comfort. I have rheumatoid arthritis so my feet sometimes swell. Since these are slip on shoes, and do have some stretch with them, they make it the perfect shoe for me. This is the 2nd pair of the skechers Summit shoe I have. Also love the color. Highly recommend"
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R2P46HPCBAQM6T,"September 14, 2018",4,A little tight but still very comfy,"I love sketchers shoes. My favorites are no longer made so I chose these. They are comfortable. I've never worn the slip on one's before and I think that may be why they felt tight to me. I like my shoes to be roomy. They hurt at first but have gotten better. I think they have to be snug since you aren't going to be tightening up your shoe laces, not sure. But I wear them for work, on my feet the whole time, and they are good."
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R39K06V8FFHOVY,"September 29, 2018",5,Lightweight and comfy!,"I love Skechers - this is my 6th pair. I do purchase 1/2 size larger than my usual, but I have noticed that is now the case with any type shoe I buy. The navy/aqua is just as pictured. I did notice a few unfavorable reviews, but not for the same color as I bought. It's interesting...if you look closely at the photos, especially at the soles and the opening you slide your foot in; they may look slightly different in the various colors. Despite this style having elastic, ""no-tie"" laces, they are easy to put on. I do find I need to wear thin-fabric socks with these, mainly no-show style (or no socks at all)."
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R3OBIPJJP35N58,"January 11, 2019",5,Beautiful shoes.,**I ordered the navy and mint colored shoes in a size 10** I wanted to love these shoes. They’re so cute. They are loose though where they should tie (if they were tie-able). I’m a true ten and size wise they were too slippy where they should be snug (at the tie area on top of the foot). That might not bother you at all. I’m super picky about my shoes so please keep that in mind when reading this review. They are comfortable and adorable. Just fit me in a weird way I didn’t like so I’m returning them.
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R2SETRO800DES,"March 8, 2019",4,Just a bit wide,"For me these shoes are just a bit wide.  I would have given them 5 stars, but there is no way to tighten them.  I would have preferred lock-tight laces as seen here:  https://smile.amazon.com/Lock-Laces-Elastic-Tie-Shoelaces/dp/B007DLVLBQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3599FK3BTOM6H&keywords=lock%2Btight%2Blaces&qid=1552064346&s=gateway&sprefix=lock%2Btight%2Blaces%2Caps%2C182&sr=8-1&th=1.  That way you could tighten them up and they would still be nice and roomy.  I hate to spend more money on them to order lock-tight laces, but may have to.  If your feet are wider, these may fit you perfectly."
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R2SM8QX805BU7B,"May 11, 2019",2,Not the Same as the Ones in the Actual Sketchers Store,"I always hear about people saying that Amazon sold knock off brands of various items on their site, and never really listened to the reviews. However, I have to say that these Sketcher's shoes did not fit like my previous pair that were purchased from the actual Sketcher's store. They fit too big, and even the soles of them were different then the original pair I had. I wound up returning these, and going to my local Sketchers store and getting a pair there. I wound up buying the exact same pair I had ordered from Amazon, and they fit much better at the store, and were not loose. This was literally the same pair, and the associate there told me the ones from Amazon looked different as well. So with that being said, I would stick with just going to your local Sketcher's store and buying these, unless you just don't have one by you. In that case, go to the Sketcher's website. At least you are guaranteed you are getting an authentic product, especially if you already know your sizing there."
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,RNO8255YYKLZ0,"August 13, 2019",5,Light weight and comfortable,"These are super light weight and comfortable.  I purchased a wide, which I normally wouldn't, but they fit perfectly.  I have a high arch and the support is great.  I tried them on at their store, but they did not have the style I wanted in a wide.  Even on my first outing with these, I got no blisters, which is a first for walking shoes.  They do not slide up and down at the heels and, even though the elastic laces cannot be tightened, they are working great.  Thus far, I am very happy with these."
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R27Z775CU1SZTJ,"July 22, 2019",4,The sole is very soft.,"I tried on shoes, the soles were very soft, but they didn't feel strong enough. The shoes felt like the feet looked bigger. I will continue to observe."

Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R104N6FNLPZNBJ,"July 20, 2019",5,Most comfortable sneakers I've ever had!,"I'm really happy with these Skechers. They are, by far, the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned. I got my usual size (9) and they fit perfectly. They're roomy inside, so my feet/toes aren't cramped at all, but the shoes themselves still look sleek -I have all the room inside I need to be comfortable without all the bulk of some other sneakers. Other roomy, comfortable sneakers look huge on my feet so that for comfort, I'm sacrificing fashion. Not the case with these at all. They're really cute, well made, and the slip on factor with no laces to bother with-definitely something I never knew I needed in my life, but can now truly appreciate. Easy to get on and off, well made, really comfortable, affordable and really cute. Best sneaker purchase I ever made. Highly recommend them."
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R3I5IUQ4G2TXRX,"November 5, 2019",5,Good,This are very nice just one thing I’m usually a 8 but these don’t have to tie maybe that’s why fit me large so I change them for a 7.5 and fit perfect!!
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R21M6O78H8J7S0,"July 22, 2019",4,They fit wide and loose,Bought some like these at Costco a couple of years ago and they ended up being my favorite sneakers ever! Ordered these from Amazon that are supposed to be like the ones I had but they fit much looser around the sides and the ankles than my other pair. I double checked to make sure I didn’t order the Wide by mistake but they are a 9M which was what I ordered. I guess I’ll just keep them but I’ll have to wear no show socks with these.
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,RD0NGJTSRCL,"October 12, 2019",3,Fits Large Even with Heavy Socks,"I purchased these sneakers in gray and dark blue after having tried the style on in a department store. They didn't fit 100% in the store but I figured it was a matter of sock choice. How I wish that was the case. The toe box fit on these gray sneakers like a dream because of their wider width. The heel was a different story. Even with heavy socks, I couldn't get a snug fit. The blue sneakers were a different story altogether. The whole shoe was wide and there wasn't an arch - just a lump located in an off position. I can't bring myself to give the shoes a two-star review because they are of excellent quality."
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R1ETOOWS6D83JQ,"June 13, 2019",5,Comfortable foot wear,This sneaker is the only footwear that I can wear comfortably.  I have a problem with finding foot wear that I can wear. I will recommend to family and friends.
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R2UY4PRAI7WLQW,"February 25, 2019",5,Walking on clouds,"The memory foam on these is unbelievable.  The moment I slipped these on, it was like a dream  Easy to walk in.. easy to keep on for hours.  I have not truly walked in these for more than a couple miles at a time, but I have worn them all day, and I wish I could say you dont even notice they are on.. but then I did notice because how good I felt every time I was on my feet.  Love!"
Skechers,Women's Summits Sneaker,B078TLWJFC,R3EGL1RKG5M095,"April 9, 2019",4,Cute but not for me,"These shoes are very similar the tie up ones I already have. I have carpal tunnel so I thought these would be easier to get on. I love the other shoes so I figured these would be good. They’re cute but the depth seems a little less than the ones I have. Also, tying the ones I have makes the size fit better. I did send them back and continue with the ones I have for the time being. If you don’t have a foot problem, I’m sure these would be great!!"
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R2G66BZD56MH1N,"January 27, 2017",5,Awesome shoes,I work at a grocery store and am on my feet all day. With my previous shoes my feet would swell but not with these bad boys. They were comfortable the second I put them on. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't even have to break them in. It's also pretty awesome not to slip around anymore. Would definitely recommend them. UPDATE: I've had these shoes for about 4 months now and they are still in pristine condition. I work around 20-30 hours a week and spill stuff on them all the time but they still haven't come apart and they are very easy to clean. My dog peed into one of the shoes (why? I do not know) but I just took the sole out and washed it and washed the rest of the shoe with warm soapy water and let it air dry. It's like it never happened.
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R1K95ZITAXIMWI,"July 25, 2017",5,Must have,"Great shoes! Very comfortable... going straight to my ""top 3 best shoes"" list. I took the insole out so you could see the cushion and how well sown the inside of the shoe is. Also took a pic of the bottom, I really will not slip in these shoes. Check out my pics."
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,RTS5WMYRDP3QU,"April 7, 2017",1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GARBAGE! Skechers Knock off?,"Extremely poorly made! I would put these in line with a Skechers knock off. Certainly no Skechers I have ever owned have come apart at the seems in just 1 and half mo. The so called  memory foam is a 2x2 in square directly un der the heal , that is about a mm thick. Garbage! I had to put in a better insole, within the week. Perhaps that is what the company has fallen to... I wear the shoes exactly 3 hours per day.  These are sold as a career shoe, some have had the nerve to compare to DANSKO. My DANSKOS' have not fallen apart like this even after 6 years. NO COMPARISON! I would never again go for a $50.00 ""career"" shoe. Lesson learned SKECHERS if that is indeed what these were. Next time I feel the need to save a few bucks, I will simply throw the money in the garbage can, and call it a day! What a joke!"
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R2CQPFQDH6EK0P,"January 6, 2017",4,The best work shoes,"I wear this shoe at least 13 hours a day in the hospital and my feet doesn't hurt at all. I also use this shoe to walk around NYC, Philly zoo, Longwood Gardens and on my daily walk outside the house. The shoe is very comfortable and light weight. This is my second pair of shoe since 2015. The size runs small, be sure to order at least 1/2 size larger than your size. I usually wear size 7 and 7 1/2 wide on skechers sneakers and boots but I order size 8 on this one and it fits well. Update: 12/04/2017 ~ My 2nd pair lasted only for 11 months months. I was working night shift and I just noticed early this morning that my left shoe has hole. I'm ordering another pair today. I just wish It will last a little longer. I'm changing my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because the shoes doesn't last very long."
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R1JS69BI5OB71D,"December 29, 2013",5,Best shoes EVER!!,I have been a waitress for 15 yrs and have never worn shoes that I didnt have to 'break in' at first. These shoes were confortable and fit perfectly from the first day!! My legs and back are not sore anymore like they used to be from that marble floor I walk on all day long!!! You have a loyal buyer from now on!! Thank you!!
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R2QZQBYLQV1XX2,"October 23, 2017",5,Confirms to foot,"Wore them at work for first time today.  I have been wearing Sketchers for work for years.  I do retail, but I went from small carpeted retail to big box, and with the change I was feeling a lot of pain.  These shoes have the foot bed and toe room to support more walking and hard flooring.  They look fine for my utilitarian job and are lightweight, which also made my workday more comfortable.  At first they felt snug but stretched quickly.  They ride high on the foot so stay firm on the foot no matter the bending or stretching needed."
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R111M13Q1CRCFF,"March 12, 2018",2,Feet very sore,"I wore these for one day and sadly, even after reading all the reviews, they just didn't work for me. I had previously had a pair of the Sketchers Go Walk lace up shoes These were amazing and I used them all the time. So, I thought that I would buy even a higher quality version to replace those, but I think the relaxed (slip on version) does not work with my feet. The fit seemed okay, but as I wore them they just got more uncomfortable. My feet were seriously sore and I had to return them. Thankfully, Amazon lets you do a return from the UPS store quickly. I'm going to go with a lace up version instead. I just wanted to help anyone out there reading reviews."
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R2PJBGI16LM178,"January 13, 2017",5,Fantastic!,"When it comes to finding shoes for a 'on your feet all day' kind of job, these are the workhorse of shoes you need to have on hand. I work retail and I can promise you, at best my feet vaguely achey after a 10 hour + day. Even if I've been running around everywhere and restocking shelves, I can still walk by the end of the night.  In contrast, my old shoes had very little in the way of support, which left me limping home by the end of my shift. If you have a similar job, I definitely recommend these shoes. These are perfect for retail, grocery store work and the like."
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R2GOEHMRODVASP,"February 13, 2019",4,Not the best - But the best I've found YET,"Fits true to size. They have a *little* arch support, but I did have to add orthotics (Dr. Foot - had to get 3/4 length ones because the insole of this shoe can't be removed.) I have narrow feet, but with the orthotics, this shoe got a bit tight. That went away after breaking them in for about a week. I work 6-8 hr shifts in a restaurant with no sit down breaks. Not gonna pretend these are actually COMFY. But at least I can bear it, which is a far cry from the two other Skechers for work styles I tried before. They ARE totally non slip though!! All in all, I guess I'd buy these again. I have another style I have my eye on though - I'll update this review to compare after I try the new ones."
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R1C7N18262XQVW,"January 23, 2019",4,Break in- order your 1/2 size and feel the difference!,"These are GREAT AND AWESOME COMFORT FROM FIRST EXPERIENCE- I’ve been after 18 months,  maternity back on the floor in bar/floor and I’ve had to wait til delivery to receive and wearing Shocks. Nonway! These were like “shallow” st first. I felt that and put them on an hr to more more my shift and the difference after 7 hrs was amazing. My TOENAILS hurt before and even with a new shoe, these saved my life. They did need a short break in and or wearing time to stretch. They worked i was good and i was so much happier even after shifts with shoes I’ve worn prior to for yr or more. Advice: put on and allow them to suck hurt and stretch and by the time you need them as long as you order a bit big or true to your okay. I’m def a 9- 9.5 and i got the 9.5 but felt like i was and in or more higher! Before breaking your feet, being miserable or leaving bad review- wear them while dressing, prepping or a day prior for a hr to 2 if possible and you’ll thank the gods. As far as skid resistant- they rocked the dish section as I’d pivot to drop and haul- I’d give the 4.5 but please allow break in. Any server with time in field (I’m 32) and a RN should Know this! :) make money! Enjoy and enjoy!"
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R1A0VZGCKTMGPE,"January 13, 2019",5,really good for waitressing,"I have had a terrible time finding non-slip, comfortable shoes. After many purchases, and buying really expensive shoes, I finally got these. The toe is not too narrow, and the sizing is perfect. I wear a 7.5 US size and that's what I ordered. I have used these for about 2 weeks now. They relieve a lot of the pressure and pain I used to have. If you are on your feet too long on a hard surface though, there isn't a shoe around that will keep you totally pain free. However, these come very close. I am a very hard walker, and I walk on tile with speed. So my previous shoe's felt like I was walking barefoot. These shoes took off a lot of that pain. Especially for the price, these are the best. The don't have shoe strings to worry about either."
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R1NKKPT361V57N,"February 27, 2018",5,My Favorite Shoe for Work and For Off the Clock,"By far, this is my preferred shoe for work and I've worked in health care nearly 30 years.  For work I wear white ones because I like the smooth, clean look of them, and I have the black ones for when I'm off the clock because of how comfortable they are, and black goes with everything.  For the first day or two, the shoes felt almost too tight just over the top of my feet (arch), but after one or two days of wear, both pairs were broken in and felt perfect.  The bottoms of my feet don't get nearly as tired or boggy feeling in these shoes because of the shock-absorbing soles.  I got the 8.5M size and it fits me fine.  I wear 8.5M - 9M in other styles and brands, including other Skechers styles, so this particular style may run a wee-teensy bit (a half-size) large."
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R2PU2VTPDT2JQ0,"June 18, 2018",5,They aren't going to make a good fashion statement but you won't either if you're limping ...,"10 stars! I stand and walk all day, every day. These shoes are where it's at. Hideous? Absolutely. Worth it? 1,000%! They will make your feet really hot and keep them that way but overall you really cannot beat the lasting comfort these babies provide. I normally wear an 8.5 or 9. I took a chance and got a 9, it fit perfectly. I would rather wear thick socks and have room than be squished all day. They aren't going to make a good fashion statement but you won't either if you're limping around because you have terrible shoes on and your feet are killing you!"

I hope Sketchers continues to make them! I need these because they are non-slip soles, my favorite work shoe!

Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R2Y0U9LRYC7WGL,"May 6, 2019",2,Runs small and narrow,"I previously ordered a different style of sketchers that ran small and had no difficulty when I size up. When I read reviews for these I assumed I would also be okay if I ordered a size larger. However, when I got these shoes I was unable to even put them on. For reference I do have wide feet but can usually wear regular width without an issue. These were a no go for me. Ordered size: 11 womens;  Regular shoe size: 10 womens"
Skechers,Work Sure Track,B00BIET56W,R38NFVH2ITZD8W,"March 7, 2019",5,Better than expected!,"I'm a delivery driver who constantly steps up and down and in and out of a van 100 plus times a day carrying boxes to door steps.  I was looking for a comfortable shoe that would be slip resistant on icy sidewalks and be somewhat bouncy to absorb the shock of landing when hitting the ground out of the van seat. That said, I have flat feet and on again off again plantar faciitis. I wore these to work without breaking them in and I had no foot pain all day. I was amazed at how bouncy and light on my feet I felt while working my delivery route. I highly recommend these for anyone who is on their feet or is constantly making harsh landings like climbing down and then taking that last last five to six inch jump down to the concrete and need to absorb the shock. My knees even felt better and my back pain was lessened. I will definitely buy a pair of these again. I think nurses, drivers, walkers, people with foot ailments or anyone on their feet all day will love these."

I buy these same white leather, non skid work shoes in the same size for years and they have always fit perfectly. This time they were too short! And not just a little; like an entire size too short. The size on the box and on the tag inside the shoes were exactly what I ordered and what had always fit before. I think that this pair was sized incorrectly and I am sending them back. I will reorder them a size bigger and see if they work, but I have a feeling they will be too big. I am giving this particular purchase a 2 star rating, but I have always loved these shoes in the past. If the new size fits well I will write another review because I really have loved these shoes for years."

Do not buy these if you work in a kitchen!! I received these on Monday and today is Friday. The fit is tolerable. My feet hurt at the end of the day (in the past this is not been a problem for me unless I wear shoes without enough support between my feet and the hard floor so I wonder about the insole quality). The top of the shoe shows poor workmanship. These are NOT NON SLIP SHOES!! They are slip resistant! The pattern is there but the sole material is wrong too hard or something - I lost traction many times. My foot has slipped out from under me quite a few times While walking. I have given these enough of a trial... It’s the weekend rushes and I will be going back to the cheap Walmart brand that give more support and complete traction in a kitchen with 4 fryers, 2 flat tops, a 12 burner and a grill. I would not let my crew wear these in my kitchen!!"

I bought these for a little part time job I started. All I do while wearing these shoes is stand on my feet for 5 hours a day maybe 3 days a week.. INSIDE. Never wore them outside. I love flip flops.... :) I don't usually follow bad reviews if I think people are exaggerating or just plain angry... I should of with these shoes. The shoes are horribly defective. They are made of the absolute cheapest faux pleather I've EVER seen. Again, I've never worn them outside, I just stand in them 15 hours a week. They do not deserve the title 'work shoes'. They are by no means durable. They started falling apart in week one. The pleather that covers the outside of the shoe likes to deteriorate to the point of embarrassment, and if you don't put them in the sunlight, they grow mold... on the top of them!! The sole also is not glued down very well. I called amazon and they gave me a full refund!! I wish I could give them 5 stars for customer service!! Sketchers on the other hand, who I actually called first, could have cared less!! After i sent them an email with my amazon receipt of purchase and attached pictures, they actually had the oddasity to request that I ship them my defective shoes (on my dime) so they can do an 'investigation' to determine if I deserve an exchange of not!!! LMAO!! No sketchers, I do not want an exchange. These shoes are defective. Thanks for absolutely no customer service what so ever. Im sorry to say I will never again purchase shoes made by sketchers. Once again, Amazon pulls through with outstanding customer service that eclipses toilet company's like sketchers!!!"

These were it! Cute, comfy, light weight! I even wear them outside of work! My only complaint would be that there isn't much for arch support in them, and not enough room to add support (tried adding some, and the shoes were too tight on the top of my foot), however, I haven't felt like I was missing the support. No foot pain yet, and been wearing them regularly for a few weeks. 1/6/17 Follow-up to my review. Still loving these shoes! Starting to feel a need for arch support, and by this point, have stretched out enough to add something on the inside. Still recommend, but plan on adding an insert at some point."

I've been using them for almost a month now as a barista and they seem to be holding up well. When I got them in the mail I was worried they would be far too narrow, but they have broken in pretty easily and are definitely the least painful work shoe I've had. The memory foam insoles are great. I find myself wearing them around the house too since they are so easy to slip on and off. The non slip soles work great for almost every other surface besides a floor covered in coffee grounds.

I gave 3 stars instead of 2 due to my own negligence. But these shoes were also very thin and snug on my feet. The toes were a lot more pointed than I expected and while the inside of the shoes feels really soft when you first try them on they don't feel the best when you work on concrete floors and have to go up and down stairs all day. I feel like if you take time to get the proper size and don't have to move around as much as I do these could be decent shoes for their price point. They just didn't work out for me."

I was also concerned about slipping so I was looking for nonslip soles. These shoes fit the bill. These are a bit wider than what I needed but I have a narrow foot (size 6.5) so I just wear thicker sports socks with them and it’s not a problem. I will say they’ve proven to prevent me from slipping on wet surfaces. If I slip at work it’s usually because there’s ice cubes on the ground or coffee grounds that I’ve stepped in (which fills all of the grooves in the sole and cancels out their nonslip ability). I’ve been wearing them for about 5 months and the support in the show has started to wane. I plan to put some orthotics in them (which works because they’re slightly too big anyway). They work exactly for what I needed them for. They keep my feet dry and safe from hot coffee. They also wipe off and clean up easily."

But huge setbacks!,I work as a Sous Chef in a very busy restaurant so these are a few things to KNOW before purchasing this shoe. 1. I have a very high instep (the top of your foot) so I wouldn’t recommend this if you do also because it hurts tremendously! 2. I bought the shoe a half size bigger because my feet are a bit wide so I catered for this thinking the 1/2 size would be ideal but it still is pretty painful to wear. 3. The foam on the bottom is really awesome because it does provide some arch support while being on your feet for so many hours in the day. 4. Finally if you’ve got a VERY narrow foot without a high instep you’d love these shoes because they do look very nice on and the memory foam on the inside is pretty comfy!

This brand is also recommended a lot, and I was so excited to get them! Well, sadly, a few hours into my first shift, my feet, ankles, and knees were all aching. I thought maybe it was a fluke so I tried them again the following week. Nope. Still offer no support. The fine print says you can’t return them if they’ve been worn, so I tried putting insoles in them to give cushion. That made them way too tight, so that wasn’t an option. I’m a server/bartender. I need shoes with great support. These are NOT those shoes. I just got recommended another style from Sketchers by a friend, but I’m nervous to try them again.

I have an insert in my shoes, so I can't say much towards the arch support of the shoe itself. It's a little tight, but not in an uncomfortable way. It feels secure on both my feet despite the size difference (I broke both my ankles, but it was separate times so they are slightly different in length and height). They're comfy to walk in without rubbing my heel. Waterproof? I live in the Pacific Northwest and I LOVE these. The weather changes at the drop of a hat most of the year and these are great for dry and wet weather. Obviously, with the low top, it's not better than rain boots when it's really coming down, but I can step in puddles without worrying. With the material being what it is, my feet do get warm faster than regular fabric. All in all, I suggest you get them."

Skechers,BOBS from Skechers Women's Keepsakes Ice Angel Slipper,B07JM4XQ1N,R24T22TJ73BQ7G,"January 4, 2018",2,Are these slippers what you REALLY want???,"I've been on a shoe hunt for slippers for the past 3 months and I've become very frustrated. I've order from many brands, primarily through Amazon, and this is my honest detailed review. Overall: I was expecting so much more from Sketchers, considering these are my favorite everyday shoe brand. These slippers missed the mark with a very high/platform heel making them more of a shoe than a slipper. Foot/Arch Support Since these shoes are more of an outside-like shoe, I would say it has some foot support. However this is NOT like the memory foam shoes that Sketchers are infamous for. Inside Cushion/Softness These slippers are more like a shoe as it doesn't really have a comfortable inside sole, as the inside fur is fluffy but the soles are still hard. You will feel like you are walking in platform heels as these are mostly flat with a bit of an arch like a tennis shoe. Outside Material/ Design / Color The shoe looks as pictured. However, the outside material (in my opinion) is what makes these shoes categorize as a slipper. The outside material is like a thin sweater rib material which wouldn't be ideal for outside wear in moist/wet weather. The fur is nice but would have felt nice with more padding inside the shoe with the fur. Bottom Grip The bottom has a good grip, better than most slippers I've reviewed so far. Again, this shoe feels like a platform heel so you will be walking like you have high heels on. Sizing/Width This shoe is true to size and has a lot of room in the toe area (maybe too much room). These shoes definitely feet like clogs with a wider toe area. Longterm Prediction Based off my experiences with Sketchers, these are definitely not what I was expecting. I feel like this shoe is durable and will last you a descent amount of time if you do not mind the heel height of these shoes. The first part that may deter the quickest is the outside sweater material that is venerability to lint and starching/ripping (from pets). Final Verdict I RETURNED THEM. I hated how much height these slippers gave and how I felt like I was walking in platform heels. I've tired and reviewed Dearfoams, Dr. Scholl's, Isotoner, Sketchers, Vionic and more on Amazon and still had no luck. I will keep trying and keep you posted... please follow my page for updates and more reviews. I hope this helped :)"
Skechers,BOBS from Skechers Women's Keepsakes Ice Angel Slipper,B07JM4XQ1N,R1FX95WHV8DVXW,"November 14, 2016",5,otherwise looks great. The only thing is that the foam is ...,"My heels of feet hurt from standing for long especially on hard surfaces. I had many different slippers before, but the sole would get squashed in too thin and I ended up adding gel inserts making it for a slippery-tripping situation. These are just as warm and cozy as regular slippers, but with a real sole, you should be able to even walk outside without problems. The knit fabric does attract cat hair a bit, otherwise looks great. The only thing is that the foam is dense, not like a soft squashy slippers usually get, but I do like it because the soft fluff usually doesn't last more than a month or two for me. Now these are pricey, and I did give these a chance on deal of the day promotion (bought two similar pairs), but considering that these are better constructed, will last very long, can walk outside in these and no need for adding inserts: I am very happy with my purchase since it will be much cheaper in the long run."
Skechers,BOBS from Skechers Women's Keepsakes Ice Angel Slipper,B07JM4XQ1N,RJ0GF3SNUMJJW,"January 24, 2017",5,BEST slippers EVARRRRRRR,"FREAKING AMAZEBALLS! I had a pair of these from a few years ago, and loved them soooo much. I wore them everyday, as a WAHM and homeschool mom, yeah I live in them!  Since Ahead of Christmas in 2015 I had been trying to find these at a low price so I could get them for my mom and mother in law and my teen daughter and my best friend. At $49, I would say they are worth every penny! But spending $200 on slippers as gifts would be a bit much, imo. So I waited for a lower price. Lo! Ahead of Christmas 2016 they went on lightning deal and I scooped them up! They were such a great price, I even replaced my own just because mine were at least 3 years old and had a couple blemishes by then. Still in great shape, just cosmetic blemishes from my daily use. I actually handed down my used pair to my young son because he is always slipping his feet in my slippers and walking off with them. He LOVES that he got my older pair! Everyone I gifted them to LOVES them! This is what I like... Super cute! I love the style! I like the knit sweater detail all over, and the furry trim. I feel so winter posh wearing them! The soles are hard and thick on the bottom. AWESOME for walking out the house to get the paper or grab something from the car or mailbox, or stand on the front porch when unexpected company drops by or meeting the UPS man to get my Amazon deliveries, or running up to the little store on the corner to grab s'mores ingredients and a Redbox movie... you get the point! These mammatammas are durable enough to go places. Even if it rains, if I am just walking out to the mailbox these will be fine because the outter sole is solid and thick. No soggy slippers here! The inside sole is firm but not hard. If you are looking for a super soft memory foam type inner sole, this ain't it. But lemme tell you, those soft sole slippers do not hold up. I have had a few memory foam slippers before and it is always surprising how quickly they get mashed and never get their shape/softness back. THESE inner soles are very comfortable, lined in the same furry stuff that you see lining the opening of the slipper. So it is still soft, but firm, and shaped nicely for your foot. Not flat. :) They hold up forever! If it weren't for the incredible deal I scooped up, I would not have replaced my 3+ year old same slippers. The only thing that happened was the toe snagged on something at some point, and the knit sweater styling started to come loose and made a hole. But the hole didn't go all the way through the slipper, it was just in the sweater covering. My toes were still warm! Other than that, they just had a slightly ""old"" look to them. You could tell they had been worn a bit, but they still were super comfy and cute, with years more life in them. I have included a picture of the old and new pair side by side. The old pair didn't have the same fur as the new pair to begin with, so don't think that they will have that matted look to them necessarily. It was a different kind of trim. I love the fur on the new ones! Honestly, these are the only slippers I ever want. Ahead of my first pair of these, I probably went through 25 different slippers in 7 years. I always had several pairs and would switch them out throughout the day because the ones I was wearing would ""go flat"". And I had some that were pricey, like my sherpa thong slippers from LL Bean. They had a hard outter sole too, but the sherpa inner sole rubbed off of them very quickly. I am on the hunt for a men's version of these. I want my hubby to have a nice pair! But I can't seem to find any. Guess he is stuck with the old stale flat memory foam ones for now. Haha! I wear a size 6 and got a size 6 and I think they fit perfectly. They are roomy, because they are slippers, not intended for running laps. I would say buy the size you are and they should fit you perfectly. I have a narrow heal and often have trouble with my heel slipping out of my shoes, but that is not an issue with the way these are designed. They are roomy enough for wide feet but don't slip off of narrow heels. The back has a low heel style, which is perfect for slipping them on and off quickly without having to use your hands. Do yourself a solid and get these!"

These things are amazing. I usually wear slippers around the house but I do have to go outside to take the dog out, get the mail, run a quick errand, and I have to change my shoes each time. These are the perfect alternative because they are warm and comfy enough to wear around the house, but they are actual shoes so I can step outside with them without worrying about messing them up. I've always been a fan of Skechers, I can't believe I didn't try these sooner!! I measured my foot and used the size chart to pick my size, which is my usual shoe size, and they fit perfect, so I'd say these are true to size."

The box was in shambles, actually in more than one piece. I am going to give them another try as the shoes looked brand new. I just can't believe that they were for the same foot!! EDIT: When I tried on one of the shoes it seemed to be about a half size too small. I was concerned that my replacement order would be slippers that were too small. I didn't try on the other right shoe at first. When I received my new order, they fit perfectly. It wasn't until then that I realized that not only did my first shipment have two right shoes but they were different sizes as well. UPDATE: I received my replacement order, a night and day difference. This time the box looked brand new, instead of being in shambles. I got both a right shoe and left shoe and they were both the same size. They fit perfectly and are very comfortable. I am now very pleased. I took off one star as the first pair never should've been sent in the first place. The condition of the box alone was terrible. I am very happy that I gave them the chance to remedy the situation.

While the left slipper fit fine and felt good, the right slipper felt odd like it had ridges in it and I was standing on them.  Uncomfortable to say the least. When I took the slippers off to examine them, I found that they were not the same inside.  The inner sole of the left slipper fit right up against the sides of the slipper, while the right slipper had a gap on the sides, which is what caused the funny feel.  I was actually walking on the edges of the inner sole instead of the sole being flush with the slipper sides.  My guess is that the inner sole was cut too small and so it did not fit correctly and was used anyway. I am returning these as I already have slippers that don't fit right and don't need another pair."

I wanted to have a pair of slippers that I could wear all day because I am sick and homebound and that I could also wear as a shoe to walk in when I go places that was really warm for the winter. It took me three days to wear them in and have them conform to my feet and now they are really warm, really cosy and really comfortable. They just need a few days to get worn in like a regular shoe. I'm glad I waited I really love them now. They are definately better than any other slippers and the are sturdier and warm and comfortable and cosy and will last years. I've had slippers that have gotten worn out after only a month or two because of constant wear but these are so well made that I know they will last me a few years.

I was looking for slippers that were warm and had a good non-slip sole that would allow me to make a quick trip to the end of the driveway for the newspaper or mail.  These slippers appeared to have these features.  I also liked the fact that they come in half sizes, as I am somewhere between a size 7 and 8.  I originally ordered the size 7 1/2.  However, they were too large.  I easily exchanged them for a size 7, which is also slightly larger than I would like, but roomy enough for a thick pair of socks in really cold weather.  The fact that they do not run true to size is the reason I  rate them only 4 stars.  However, they are extremely comfortable, and for that reason, I recommend them."

I have been wearing a 7 1/2 or 8 xwide shoe and would have ordered these in 8 w if not for the reviews. I ordered 7w and they felt ok out of the box with a pair of medium weight sox. After a few days wear, I can wear a thick cotton sport sock with a pair of fuzzy footy sox over them, so not only do they run big, I think the sole compacts down and makes them seem even bigger. In spite of all this I still gave them 4 stars. At least they have a REAL sole, not that fake memory foam inside a thin plastic shell kind you find on a lot of slippers now.....SO, cute, comfortable but run reeeealy big.

Skechers,BOBS from Skechers Women's Keepsakes Ice Angel Slipper,B07JM4XQ1N,RRZMVXU6QF8FF,"February 7, 2019",4,Nice warm slippers - here's how to choose correct size,"SIZING ADVICE: if you want to wear these slippers with bare feet only, get your usual size. If you want to wear them with socks like I do in the wintertime, order UP a half-size. I live in snow country in Colorado; I wear medium-to-heavyweight wool-blend socks with the shoes I wear outside in the winter. When I come home, I remove my snow-covered shoes and need slippers which I can easily slide into WITH MY SOCKS ON. My floors are cold even with good carpeting and padding, so I never walk around in just socks or my bare feet in the wintertime. I also need a true shoe-type sole on my slippers so I can go out on my deck to shovel off the snow & refill the bird feeders, or run something out to my car if there isn't 2"" or more of fresh snow on the ground. I found these BOB's while clicking around on Amazon's website and they appeared to meet my requirements for some new winter slippers. I originally ordered my usual size 8M since some reviewers stated they ran large; once they arrived & I tried them on I realized they fit me ONLY if I wore them barefoot. They were too small when trying to wear them with socks - even jamming my toes as far as possible into the toe box my heels barely fit into the back end of the slipper. I could tell the furry lining would not 'pack down' enough over time to allow an easy fit with socks.  Thanks to Amazon's easy 'free exchange' program, I returned the size 8M (at no cost to me) and ordered a size 8.5M of the same slipper, same color. They arrived today and ta-da - my sock-clad feet fit perfectly inside! Despite an outside temperature of -1F and cool floors my feet are staying nice & toasty-warm tonight. :-) There is some arch support in the insole; probably sufficient for use as slippers for 2-3 hrs/day. However, on my days' off I sometimes wear my slippers all day; I may have to put a 3/4-length arch support on top of the insole to add the extra arch height my feet would require for prolonged use (this slipper's insole is not easily removable)."

They are nice for what I paid, especially considering we have linoleum floors throughout our base house. ***UPDATE*** The shaggy fur lining the outside of my slipper is showing bald spots.

I should have ordered a straight 9 because the toe box on these are narrow and it’s definitky not a true size 8 1/2. I wore them hoping they’d stretch out but they haven’t done so.  My foot pushes against the front very uncomfortably in order to fit the back on my foot into the shoe. Very unhappy with this but can’t return it. The thick smoke is about the only nice feature on them. It doesn’t feel like memory foam is the footbed. It’s very hard. Bearpaw makes a much better product

I don’t even dwell that much, but at the end of the day working a 12-16 hour shift In the ER, I definitely have indentations on the tops of my feet from where I was swollen. They are far from uncomfortable though. They may get snug during the last hour or two of your shift, but it’s hardly noticeable, honestly. I am also used to replacing shoes every 6-9 months because I am constantly working 16 hr shifts in the ER (specifically trauma bays) and running everywhere....so I can destroy some shoes. I e had this pair for over 2 years and they have a LOT of life in them. I have had just about every make of shoes there are for nursing too...I would recommend these or Grey’s Anatomy that look just like these.

My feet at the toes are touching the top of the boot due to the thick cushion in the shoe. I contact seller about returning and was told I’d have to pay $17 to return the item.  The boot is so uncomfortable to wear and there’s no way i can work in these
Skechers,Work Women's Brooten,B005A19N2K,R1UDDJ4NSVBLX7,"November 5, 2017",4,"Runs small, otherwise EXTREMELY comfortable","Excellent boots for work, very high quality, but really tight on the toes. I couldn't find an option for wide-width. I had to break these in before wearing them for a full shift, but once I did the comfort is AMAZING. My feet and back no longer throb after work, and I literally walk miles at work on solid concrete which chews through cheaply made shoes fast. I don't believe I will have that issue with these."
Skechers,Work Women's Brooten,B005A19N2K,RGGE40AH3PA1M,"March 3, 2019",2,WAY TO SMALL.,"I have different pair of Sketchers boot that are size 7.5. I ordered the same size and they were way too small. I bought another pair from somewhere else, because I did not know when size 9 would be available. Size 9 and they fit great."

Skechers,Work Women's Brooten,B005A19N2K,R2N3P9EJGRWXAF,"January 22, 2018",5,Just what I wanted,The sole problem s very comfortable I was hesitant to make the purchase because of the size and was worried they would run to big or two wide yet they are true to size I would definitely purchase again or in another color the best thing is that they do not look oversized and are very comfortable
Skechers,Work Women's Brooten,B005A19N2K,R1CPCFCSQIV7QV,"November 24, 2019",3,Durable,"I have to wear steel toe for work and was looking for a pair that had good traction on bottom of boot. My last pair were Justin’s steel toe and they just slip on concrete. These Sketchers do much better. Only complaint is the toe area is a bit narrow, they rub the back of the calf area and very stiff. They are steel toe so they are a heavy boot as expected but so far very durable."
Skechers,Work Women's Brooten,B005A19N2K,R3PXZGGP3A70CM,"January 20, 2020",3,Not a fan,"Felt like it was tight and uncomfortable. I really like Skechers and figured for comfort, I would go with these but im not a fan of the style or fit. I've never purchased a work boot before so I have no other experiences to go on. I have only worn them about 5 times and maybe they need to be broken in.. idk"

Skechers,Work Women's Brooten,B005A19N2K,R2EJBWQPOJKIHY,"February 7, 2020",2,"Runs, uncomfortable, no traction","These boots say they're slip resistant, but I find myself slipping and sliding. No traction. I like the fit, except where the steel toe starts (at the bottom of the toes). Rubs the toe knuckles and makes it very uncomfortable. Also rubs on the calves. Hurts even with socks on. We'll see how long they last!"

I was a little skeptical initially to buy this, since there were no reviews, but I went ahead anyway because I liked the design and knit fabric would mean it would be soft and comfortable. It is as expected. Good, snug fit and looks nice for daily wear.  I will be updating my review after a few months of usage in case it does not hold up."

Soft, walking on clouds feeling, lots of flexibility due to the stretchy knit structure of the shoe. They also look kind of dressy and the navy blue color is very pretty. Walked two miles right out of the box. Comfortable is my main criteria and cute is an added bonus."

Please Skechers, make 1/2 sizes for the larger feet!!!  I had to buy size 11.  They are a little bigger than I want, but are so cute - I can wear dressed up or down - they are perfect with skirts and casual dresses.  PLEASE MAKE THEM IN BLACK!!!  AND RED!!  AND WHITE!!!  I would buy one pair in each color. :)"

They are very giving and cushiony. These are not structured shoes which is normally what I look for (semi structured anyway) in a shoe, but loved the Mary Jane style and had to have these. I would not wear these while flying from one city to the next, but only because my neuropathic feet need support all around my feet. For anyone else, these would be perfect. Easy on, easy off and OH SO CUTE !!!!!!"
Skechers,Women's Seager-Power Hitter-Engineered Knit Mary Jane Flat,B07HWQ3MXG,R2R9MEM8NUULEI,"September 26, 2019",4,"Good shoe, not quite as comfy as other models","I love these shoes, but they aren't quite as comfortable as I had hoped they would be. I've had others from Skechers and these are still good! I'm on my feet for up to 13 hours a day so my needs are a little more specific. I tried adding an insole but it warped the shape of the shoe so i took it out. If you're looking for a walking shoe or something to slip on def buy these. If you need more support and long term wear....maybe try another shoe."

The only issue is I needed to order a half size up. I ordered the 9, which is the size I wear, but the 9 in the Seager was just too short. I ordered a 9.5 and they are a little long. Not an issue. I can place a shoe insert inside."

However they are not intended for long distance walking. I used them for my recent trip to Paris where I did several miles of walking. My toes hurted so bad and one of them was bleeding. I am thin and fit with narrow feet. Won’t do that mistake again. Good tennis shoes are needed for long walks."

Not fancy enough for a cocktail dress, they work well with business professional and church outfits and so comfortable with enough support even for short walks.  The elastic strap may last long but so far so good."

Sturdy enough to handle uneven surfaces walking thru castles & ruins yet dressy enough for business casual wear.
Skechers,Women's Street Cleat. Canvas Contrast Stitch Lace Up Sneaker,B07H61FSBZ,R15I2AQSX5RPM,"March 16, 2019",5,"Comfortable, cushioned & cute","This canvas shoe is great if you need more cushion than regular flat canvas sneakers like Converse. I love the platform sole for a little extra height. I got my regular Skechers size and they fit perfect. I have a slightly wide foot, and the toe box was nice and roomy. However, The heel is a little wide for me, but it doesn’t rub, so it doesn’t bother me. I walked in them all day and they felt great."
Skechers,Women's Street Cleat. Canvas Contrast Stitch Lace Up Sneaker,B07H61FSBZ,R3A3HQJSLVBXMC,"May 6, 2019",5,Cute and comfortable shoes,"I wore these shoes right out of the box and went shopping for 4hrs. These shoes are very comfortable. I'm a size 7.5 and these were true to size. I wore it with skinny jeans, shorts, cropped jeans and it looked great with all of them. The platform added a tiny bit of extra height but didn't make that much of a difference to me, being 5'6"". I loved it so much that I ordered them in white, and also the suede ones in gray and pink. Also, the black shoes came with white laces already laced up along with extra pair of black laces."
Skechers,Women's Street Cleat. Canvas Contrast Stitch Lace Up Sneaker,B07H61FSBZ,R2Q5YSZF3OVNU2,"April 29, 2019",5,Love Skechers,"I wanted a pair of white canvas sneakers to wear this summer with dresses, skirts...everything.  I looked over all the choices and found these.  I ordered Skechers boots a year ago, a black pair and brown, size 8 and they are the best boots I've ever had.  I ordered these sneakers in 8 also and they fit my foot perfectly.  They don't make my foot look big, like some white shoes can.  I have a wider foot and this was perfect.  I don't like my big toes to rub on top of the shoe and they don't.  Just enough toe room.  They are cushioned and there is an arch which I need.  I'd usually insert something, but I don't need to with these.  They are perfect!"
Skechers,Women's Street Cleat. Canvas Contrast Stitch Lace Up Sneaker,B07H61FSBZ,R1CCL26P9VDZSL,"May 16, 2019",5,Super cute sneaks....Fit large,"After reading numerous reviews of these sneakers, all or most stating that they run absolutely true to size, I found them to run a 1/2 large. I am a true size 8 in most shoes and boots, even wearing an 8 1/2 in some styles and sandals. The size 8 in these sneakers were definitely too big. With every step, my ankle slipped about halfway out of the shoe, and the overall fit was too big even with a pair of ankle socks. I just received my size 7 1/2 in these and it fits perfect. Not tight or small in any way. That said, I love these sneakers! The platform sole is so cute and they couldn't be more comfortable. I ordered them in black and in the white canvas. The white pair is actually not bright white, which I prefer, more like winter white/off-white. I really don't care though, as they are perfect in every other way. I highly recommend these sneakers, just be aware they could run a little large."

Wore them seven days straight without any discomfort while doing a lot of walking from early morning to bedtime. I was pleasantly surprised with the arch support, enough room in the toe box and padding at the heel collar. Platform soles really cute and stable. Would but again."

Canvas Contrast Stitch Lace Up Sneaker,B07H61FSBZ,R3DSA2LN630554,"July 27, 2019",5,"Super cute, super comfy, super 90's!","I wore shoes just like these in the 90's, so they are very nostalgic for me. I'm so glad they're making a comeback because I love the look. I ordered my normal size 8.5 & found they run a little large & wide, but not to the extent where I couldn't wear them or needed to return them. They fit & feel like they've already been broken in the first time I slipped them on. I love that! They are super comfortable & provide a decent amount of support. I love wearing them to work where I can't wear full on tennis shoes, but we can wear more casual shoes. I've been wearing them a few months & they have held up really well & are my ""go to's"" when I'm looking for comfort. I really appreciate that the box included white & black wide laces. Very nice quality laces that look so cool. I only wish the laces were a bit longer because there is just barely enough lace left to tie your shoes. If you're looking for a pair of every day, comfy shoes, I highly recommend these!"
Skechers,Women's Street Cleat. Canvas Contrast Stitch Lace Up Sneaker,B07H61FSBZ,R2QKONFSB4T4ZS,"June 30, 2019",4,"Great cushioned shoe, good for wide foot, high arch. Heel sinks a bit low though.","Bought these a half size up at DSW (shoe warehouse) locally. Great fit, great arch, wide width even though they are medium width. The half size up gave me the width I needed without being too long. They don't come in wide sizes. I saw them on Amazon for $15 less than DSW so bought them again here and returned the ones I got at DSW. Hoping these will walk the distance on upcoming vacation. So far no major sore spots wearing them in. Skechers are well cushioned shoes for my chronically sore feet. Only negative is that the heel sinks a bit lower than the arch which means less cushioning and odd feel, but a gel insert fixed that."
Skechers,Women's Street Cleat. Canvas Contrast Stitch Lace Up Sneaker,B07H61FSBZ,RGREUWWBIANY2,"July 10, 2019",5,Like the shoes,They are very cute and also comfortable. I love them. The only concern that I have is to keep them clean because they are made of canvas.

I can wear them all day and my feet don't hurt. It took a while to break in the heel area. I wasn't wearing socks with them and I kept getting blisters, but they are fine now. I would like to get a navy pair, but they seem to be sold out all the time. Very cute and I like the platform look to them - definitely recommend."

The toe box isn't roomy.  I thought it was merely the fact that I have been through a broken foot and is still very tender.  After having two additional people try them on and I heard the same comments as me.  Small toe box,.width too slender and a punchy heal I no longer felt badly for the shoes not fitting."

My feet feel safe in them and even though it is best to wear them with compression sock, I often wear them without any socks at all and my feet are not worse for the wear.  They are well made, look great and cuter than the standard Sketchers I was wearing.  Although the others are super soft and super easy to slip into and out of... these are more stylish and less ""old ladylike"".  Just a cooler looking shoe and more substantial."

Canvas Contrast Stitch Lace Up Sneaker,B07H61FSBZ,R2WAA5JZJNSQ40,"December 5, 2019",4,So cute!,"I absolutely love how cute these shoes are and I am always getting compliments on them. I purchased the black and white ones. I normally buy the Sketchers De'lites for work and they were always comfortable right out of the box so I was hesitant to buy a different style. My hesitation was for good reason too. These were uncomfortable until I broke them in (took about two weeks of wearing 4 days a week) but now I don't have any issues with them except that they squeek when I walk. That isn't an actual issue for me, it just gets more people to notice them. Lol They did lose one star though because they weren't comfy straight out the box and they're noisy."

I did try this on in store before purchasing online so I knew they would fit as expected. I have a higher than usual instep so the 9 makes it easier to slide the shoe on.

Skechers,Women's Go Walk Lite - Eclipse Boat Shoe,B075Y2ZDPY,RFSEB5OLMBKT7,"September 1, 2019",4,Most comfortable for flat feet,I have the same shoe in the grey cloth and like it just a little better than this one.  The reason is because the grey is a slip on even though it shows shoe strings -  you dont have to tie them.  This beige is a vinyl like material and you have to tie the shoe strings.  But the memory foam sole in both are the best.  My grey ones are about 6 months old and the soles have not gone flat yet.

These are the holy grail of comfort! I wear a 9 and the base/foot area fits perfect, but the top part that holds your feet in are a bit large. I put the small socks on and it was a little better, but I have wide front feet and because of that, I'm sticking with a 9 or my little toes get squished. An 8.5 would probably be too small. I just stood outside for 45 minutes watering my 70 trees in the heat and my feet were so comfy--like I'm wearing slippers! And they are sooooo stylish looking!!! I just bought a pair in black for my sister and another one for my mother. Then, I checked today and they had a 9 in light pink in stock (albeit for $60!), but I really had to have light pink cause it's my favorite color! So 4 pairs purchased and I know my sister and mother will love them, because we all have back, neck and knee issues. I work from home and I'm in my sweats, but I wanted to take some pics just now so you could see them. Woohoo! Thanks, Skechers. You always deliver!"
Skechers,Women's Ultra Flex-First Take Sneaker,B078WVXYXG,R3USV1TK23FAB1,"July 20, 2018",5,... God I wanted an invisible shoe so I could comfortably walk on air while barefoot,"I told God I wanted an invisible shoe so I could comfortably walk on air while barefoot.  This shoe isn't invisible but it sure is like walking on air.  I have wide feet with bunions and corns and after seeing a review of someone's mom's face spreading into a smile after putting these on, I knew I had to try them.  My feet tend to swell in hot weather so lengthwise I am an 8 but I ordered 8.5. When I first put them on they felt big in length and the backs slid up a bit (shoe stayed on), but after wearing them for a day I don't have that problem.  Now I just need them to make something in a dress sandal that feels this good!"

Due to health issues I have problems with blood flow to my feet.  Most shoes/sneakers out there squish my toes.  The only thing better, UGGs, but I can't wear them in summer.  I recommend these sneakers to everyone!"

Skechers,Women's Ultra Flex-First Take Sneaker,B078WVXYXG,R3AMZEN9D0C8EH,"September 3, 2018",5,Great casual slip on shoes... great interim athletic shoes,"These are the best shoes. I bought them so I have something easy that I could slip on before going outside to play ball or frisbee with my dogs.  What  I found though, is that I am wearing them all the time. They are a perfect casual shoe to slip on. Also very easy to get on when I’m going to cycle class, and I just change into my cycle clip in shoes once I get there. They do stay put too.  So, easy to slip on, and they stay in place. I received quite a few compliments on them too. I did have to exchange my original purchase, for a half size smaller though.  So maybe order half a size smaller than you think."
Skechers,Women's Ultra Flex-First Take Sneaker,B078WVXYXG,R30FXQ75C8XNJK,"September 17, 2019",5,Best shoe ever. Worth the price,"I have loved these shoes since they first arrived. This new one fits like a glove. I have a wide foot at the first joint of my big toe to the pad of my little toe. I have always had trouble finding a shoe that I could wear all day without being in pain at the end of the day. It’s light and I can feel the air flow as I walk. If you have trouble getting a good fit, get this shoe. I wear a size 8 and I was worried that they would be too small because the other shoes were made in China. I love this shoe and I think you will be happy as well. The price is the only thing that gave me a thought that maybe I should buy the other ones that are cheaper. It’s worth the price to have a shoe that fits so well. If you have trouble with your feet swelling, get this shoe. The material and the bottom will work for you."
Skechers,Women's Ultra Flex-First Take Sneaker,B078WVXYXG,R1M675W8UZ2M5O,"September 10, 2018",5,Fit is perfect.,"I LOVE these shoes. I went out and bought some arch supports, first, to put in these shoes. I mostly wear them to walk around the house while I'm cleaning. They are easy to slip on and off. They fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable. I was wearing slippers around the house and my feet and back hurt so bad because of it. These shoes help my feet not hurt so much. There are times when I can't even tell that I'm wearing any shoes at all. That's how comfortable they are! I don't wear socks around the house, so this review is for bare feet in the shoe."
Skechers,Women's Ultra Flex-First Take Sneaker,B078WVXYXG,R1QPTBA255BPEM,"February 18, 2019",5,47 miles at Disney World!,I have multiple foot and ankle problems due to injuries.  I also have some neuropathy in my left foot.  We just returned from a trip to DisneyWorld where I walked 47 miles in 7 days.  These shoes are absolutely the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  They conform to my foot and allow for swelling at the end of the day.  I have two pairs and would buy more if merchants carried them in more colors.
Skechers,Women's Ultra Flex-First Take Sneaker,B078WVXYXG,RFXWX44O8UF5P,"February 5, 2020",5,stretch fit skechers,"I have many pairs of skechers and because of a foot deformity I have to buy 2 different sizes - I say this because  a good fit on a pair of pull on shoes is critical.  These are an interesting version - the tops are higher up your foot than others.  But the top is stretchy.  I went with my usual 8 and 9 - and they work - but I will say that the 9 seems a bit shorter at the toe than others I own.  I may have to switch up to the 9 1/2 in this style.  My feet are average in width but I feel like this shoe will work for people with a bit of a wider foot too because of the stretch top - the foot bed is not super wide - so if you have a really, really wide foot the top may work, but the bed may not be a perfect fit.  The sole is a different print than some - less spread out and deep - which is good because my favorite pair of skechers has that wide, deep sole print and it picks up all the little rocks from everywhere.  I purchased the black tops with black soles.  I personally don't like a white sole unless the tops are white or light colored.  The heel back looked a bit worrisome to me - I worried about rubbing - but it doesn't so far.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful."

They are light weight and absolutely comfortable.  I usually wear a size 6.5 but opted to go to a size 7 since they hug your whole foot.  Very happy I went a half size up, I can wear them with or without socks.  Sneaker does not slide off either way. I wore them today for a 2 mile walk and my feet were not achy at all.  Cushion is great.  I will be ordering another color."

It has been hard to find good shoes. But these shoes were a shock when I got them my foot on the right side slipped into the shoe so easily and NO PAIN at all! I was shocked! Usually I would have to put toe shoes into the shoe to raise up the shoe over the right toes, but not now! It is so comfortable to wear and enjoy no pain when I walk.Thank u for these shoes!!!"

My purchase history in brief, I've bought NIKE shoes in the past and their shoes are not comfortable. and cost more.  However, this sketcher walking shoe keeps my feet happy. I bought a second pair from Amazon that is a tiny bit tight but it is not a problem for me. First pair bought at Macy's was on sale for around $40.

I don't think it is pretty, but for walking, comfort is much more important.  There is no arch support, which I am thankful for, as I am flat footed and cannot wear and arch support. I looked at the Skechers to begin with because Ringo Starr advertised them, and I thought they must be comfortable if he would wear them on stage and to play the drums."

Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong size & had to return them. May re-order in the next few days selecting the correct size. I returned them at Kohl's which was a breeze. And Kohl's gave me a 25% off coupon to use in their store thanking me for using them to return my Amazon product. It was 25% off the total and not for just one item. I bought 2 shirts & 2 prs of sandals for a grand total incl tax of $33!!! What a deal with Amazon & Kohl's!!"

I did not notice that when they came in I took them from the box tried them on they were a little tight it was late in the evening and the over headlights were off. Hubby threw the box out and 2 days later I went to put them on and noticed how dirty the insides were. They could not have gotten dirty the 2 minutes I had them on, I even had on socks.

Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 2 Slip-On Walking Shoe,B009ZDF06W,R2TOF6ICVNVXLI,"November 9, 2017",5,HAPPY FEET,"In a way I hate to get started writing this review.  There almost is no way to stop telling anyone and everyone how wonderful this particular shoe in the Skecher line is.  It lines up with superb comfort and wear ability.  I bought my first pair of the Go Walk 2 Slip-On when they first arrived on the shelf years ago, I wore these exclusively if I wasn't wearing a particular comfort style of a Croc.  I don't buy shoes to fit my apparel. I now buy apparel to fit with my Skechers Go Walk. At one point when Skechers stopped making this particular version, I took any opportunity to express my regret and displeasure with Skechers for letting go of this one.  All other Skecher versions were okay, but either slipped up and down on my heel, did not fit the same, and was not as flexible which caused some pain to my big toe. It looked like there was not going to be any more Skechers for me once my 2 reliable Go Walk 2's were done for - worn out. (BTW, these old first pairs are still going strong.) But, gratefully, the Go Walk 2 has returned, at least on Amazon, and I now have about 3 pair on the top shelf of my closet being reserved for the day I may need to replace my original pairs, especially if they stop making these again. The comfort is Sooo unique that I truly have felt that maybe walking on clouds might feel the same.  And besides that, these shoes actually made me ""want to walk"".  The feet just don't get tired when wearing these.  There is no place I want to go or nothing I want to do that would require me to leave these shoes behind and resting in a shoe closet.  They are happy to be on my feet and my feet are Happy they are there. [I wasn't paid to make this review.  I offer it freely to you, no strings attached.]"
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 2 Slip-On Walking Shoe,B009ZDF06W,R2AQIK08PR95IG,"March 10, 2014",5,"On the 8th Day, God created Skechers Go Walk","I know I need to exercise, and the exercise of my choice is walking. I have ""difficult"" feet to find shoes for, they're rather wide and I have a high arch.  I've tried Grasshoppers, Keds, Dr Scholl's, Easy Spirit, Sperry's, Earth Shoes, Clarks, Aerosoles, all trying to find the perfect shoe for me.  While all the others have been tolerable, my feet have always hurt somewhat at the end of the day after wearing all the other brands.  Some brands stress the ball of my foot, others are a tad too narrow and squish my toes, some rub the heel...nothing major, but nothing has truly been comfortable, just tolerable. I thought I'd just have to resign myself to having chronically tired feet. Until I tried on a pair of Skechers. I swear, as soon as I slipped my foot into my Skechers, the sun came out from behind the clouds, small woodland creatures came out from hiding to frolic about, and a sweet little flock of birds gently placed a halo of flowers on my head.  There was also a chorus of angels singing somewhere in the distance. I was too busy crying tears of joy to pay attention as to where. These. Shoes. Are. Heaven. The gang at Skechers are obviously in cahoots with the angels, because they have some sort of agreement with the angels not to allow anyone's feet to touch the ground while wearing them. I don't walk anymore, I am transported down the walking path on a cloud of sheer unadulterated comfort by delightful little cherubs, hired by Skechers. You can't see them, of course, but my feet know they are there, oh yes, they do. I serenely wave at passers-by as I float by them. I stop random strangers on the walking path to tell them how comfortable these Skechers are, and how delightful the cherubs that convey me and my happy feet down the walking path are. These shoes are as lightweight as a cloud conveyed by cute cherubs should be. I bought four more pair (in different colors) and will be bringing them on an upcoming trip. They weigh next to nothing and I actually hate to take them off at the end of the day.  There is NO ""breaking in"" period, they are heaven right out of the box.

I have 2 pair in different colors.  It's like walking in your slippers--so comfortable.  I had bunion surgery and none of my shoes, including tennis shoes, felt comfortable.  I wish I could afford to buy these in every color.  If they get any dirt on them, they can be wiped with a moist cloth and look good as new."

My feet scream at me for a week if I even look at them weird.  I also have an opportunity to go on an extended vacation in Europe later on in the summer and unfortunately, I'm going to have to bring the feet I was born with, so I have been on the hunt for a shoe that will keep those angry feet happily silent whilst walking around for miles (or kilometers as it were) looking at art and architecture. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! I had to go to a conference for work last week and figured this would be a great time to do a test run on walking shoes for my vacation.  The hotel was over 3 miles from the convention center and my boss is fit as a fiddle and insisted on walking there and back EVERY FREAKING DAY!  Those walks combined with walking around the convention and general site seeing in Chicago meant that we walked between 9 and 12 miles each and every day for a week.  I am not a fit person and I may be sporting a few more pounds than I should.  This is a recipe or disaster. I will be perfectly honest - my calves were killing me.  My hips have threatened to disown me.  My lower back and I are no longer on speaking terms.  But my feet?  My jacked-up feet that refuse to cooperate on any distance traveled beyond that between my couch and fridge - happy as freakin' clams!  Not a peep from the troubled twosome!  (I have since started walking a minimum of 2 miles a day to give those calves, hips and back an attitude adjustment and am pleased to report they are falling into line like good little soldiers). I am buying a second pair right now because whenever I find a great pair of shoes, I run them into the ground and when I go to replace them, I end up screaming in frustration that they are no longer being made. BUY THESE SHOES They may not be the most fashion forward design, but they are comfy as all get out!  Trust me.  Your feet will thank you."

You practically need a shoe horn to get these on because they've made the foot hole so small.  The fabric is very tough, and wearing these for any amount of time causes foot pain.  Very disappointed since the earlier version was soft, the memory foam was excellent, and they slipped easily on and off.  I will start a search for another shoe company that makes quality, and abandon sketchers after purchasing six pair in the past two years."

The color I really wanted, the black Wavelength (multi-colored soles, very cute) are absolutely sold out by every vendor in the world, so I bought a navy blue pair at a local store and started looking for black. My size was not available locally, so I ordered from Amazon.  They came, they are just as comfortable as my blue pair, and I am mostly happy. . .but they are different in some minor ways. I didn't notice while ordering, but the pair I ordered is the Go Walk 2.  Here are the differences from the original Go Walk: The fabric is rougher.  I don't feel it inside the shoe, but the look on the outside is sportier, and I don't think I will wear them with summer skirts and dresses, as I had planned. There is something blockier about the look of the shoe.  The vamp is higher on the top of the foot and the toe box is slightly wider. Again, I will wear these shoes happily.  But in my search for more colors (yes, this is an obsession now!), I will make sure I buy the original Go Walk version.  They are just cuter!"

The price of these shoes can be ridiculous. I would never pay more than $25 for them.

The prices vary between sizes and colors so when they drop below $30 in my size and a decent color, I usually buy.  Costco sometimes has them for $20 but never in my size (women’s 11) so $30 is the best deal I’ve found.  I  They retail for $55-$60 on Zappos.

If they had this same shoe available in a cute color or design I like they'd be a 5 star item for sure! I've had these for about 3 months and I'm still very pleased with them. I work in a hospital that is 13 stories high and spans across 2 blocks, because of my job I frequently walk the entire distance several times a day. If I'm not doing that, I'm still standing and walking around 8-12 hrs 5 or more days a week. So far these shoes have shown very minimal wear and are very comfortable. While we do have anti-fatigue mats at work, we don't get to stand on them much since we're not standing still in 1 place. There have been many days over the years that I can barely stand to walk from my car into my home at the end of the day because my feet hurt so bad! I had to switch to shoes without laces because I have had issues where the laces come untied while I'm at work at I trip on them. Not good when you're in a hurry and carrying expensive or life saving medications! These shoes have really made my work days much easier as I can slip them on quick knowing they'll stay put all day and, most importantly, my feet don't hurt after a normal shift!"
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 2 Slip-On Walking Shoe,B009ZDF06W,RNRM14TTMMWDR,"March 13, 2015",5,Near-perfect comfort & casual style,"Let me qualify my answers to the questions above...first, however, I LOVE these shoes. I have very hard to fit feet, with narrow heels, wide instep and very high arches - I usually detest looking for shoes cuz it is nearly impossible to find anything I can even stand up in, much less walk around a bit. These shoes take care of most of these problems, tho, and with the addition of an arch support orthotic, they become pretty perfect for me.  The heels don't slide off and they are padded enuf so they don't rub and cause blisters, there is enuf toe room (but not too much), they are very lightweight, they clean easily and they look quite smooth and nifty! As for qualifying my answers above: I really can't say whether they fit ""as expected"" because I've never noticed that women's shoes adhere to any consistent regimen of size. In my closet now are shoes ranging from 7.5 - 11, and they all ""fit"". I'm just glad that these shoes have a size that worked for me, if ya know what I mean! The only reason I could order these online is that I've already got a pair that I bought in a store after trying on about 4-5 different sizes! The fact that the 9.5s happen to be perfect is why I'm ordering a second pair QUICK before they go out of stock or the model is changed or discontinued! But Skechers really does have the right idea with this model. I just hope they are popular enough for the company to keep producing them! I will definitely buy more."

I have not walked any long distance in them yet.  Sketchers are simply comfortable.  I bought my first pair last year in a different model.  What I am disappointed in is the color was supposed to be black with white soles like the photo in the product posting.  There are two Black options, but one is Black with Silver.  What arrived was murdered out, entirely Black Sketchers Go Walk 2.  I really wanted the Black ones with the White soles as in the picture.

However, I live in the High Desert and the roads are black asphalt, I was trying to keep my soles cool as possible.  Arch support is great for me but I have a low arch.

It was a little snug, but once my foot was in, it was fine.  The first day I wore them I thought they were the most comfortable shoes ever!  I really enjoyed how light they were and how they supported my feet.  The second day, we walked four miles and I ended up with raw, bloody blisters on my heels.  I'm not sure why the difference in the two days, I really didn't wear different types of socks, but my feet were a painful mess.  It's been a couple of weeks and I've just started wearing them again.  This time I put deodorant on my heels before I put them on and I'm certainly not doing four miles. They are comfortable and light and my feet don't sweat in the Florida heat. I like them, i would just suggest a slower breaking in period than I tried."

I have tried many types of shoes, but they never seem to work -- my bum foot starts to ache and it throws my stride off so my back and hip end up hurting. For the past couple of years I have worn only Romeo boots (box toe; don't laugh, I've walked half-marathons in them.) Recently we took a trip to Mexico, and the thought of clomping around in the heat in boots was too much. The reviews for these Sketchers GoWalks sounded good, so I ordered a pair. When they came, I immediately walked four miles on the treadmill with them, and had absolutely no problems.  Feeling embolded, a day or two later I walked six miles outside, and again, to my utter surprise, had no problems. I ended up wearing the shoes to Mexico, walked many miles in the heat with them (some days 12  to 13 miles), and had no problems. I am delighted with these shoes and intend to order a few more pairs while I can get them."

I bought these after having great success with the Go Walk 2 Hypo walking shoe. Those shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. These shoes are almost as good, but not quite. I wear a size 7 most of the time, and my feet are just a little bit on the wide side. These shoes fit as expected, with plenty of room in the toe box. I have not had any problem with heel blisters in either pair, and I have wimpy heels that seem to blister if you look at them the wrong way. These shoes differ from the Hypo shoes in two ways: 1) The memory foam is good, but not quite as cushy; 2) On the left shoe only, I could immediately feel the seam right at the base of my inner arch rubbing against my skin. (For whatever reason, the seam on the right shoe doesn't bother me at all.) I fixed the problem pretty easily by putting a moleskin callous cushion over the seam. The Hypos have a seam in the same spot, but it must be less raised than the ones in these shoes. All this having been said, I would recommend these shoes to anyone."

The memory gel insole is awesome. My feet are no longer sore after hours of standing. One caveat though -- DO NOT GET THEM SOAKED IN WATER. The smell will knock you out. I looked it up and apparently there is some weird issue with the insole that makes it smell if it gets really wet. I thought I had terrible foot odor (which I have never had in my life) but it was the shoes. I ended up washing them in my washing machine with detergent and vinegar, and some oxyclean powder inside each sneaker. When they air dried (two days later), they were fine. I am using my first pair as knockaround shoes and saving the new pair for when I want perfectly white, clean shoes and know I won't be walking through puddles."

I like memory foam soles.  I like aerated shoes.  I am very happy to tell you these are my second pair.  I wore out the first. Only dislike is my big toe tends to wear a hole in the top of the shoe.  Would like straighter toes or tougher material there. But what I really don't like is the fact that Skechers has very few white tennies.  I don't need psychedelic  colored shoes.  Or every color of the kids crayon  box tennies.  I happen to think white tennis are very attractive.  I know they sell well because you are running out of them.  So Skechers if you want me to buy a third pair you better learn that some women don't need attention so badly that they would buy psychedelic  colored sneakers.

She’s always on her feet and doesn’t like to be sitting too long so these shoes actually came in perfect for her she’s always walking around the house in her garden outside check in the mail and these have never given her problems for her feet. She has always been taking care of her shoes and these are her favorite. I try to buy her a pair every two years so that she doesn’t wear them down as much and she always request these shoes because they’re so comfortable versatile and fashionable when she does wear them"

It's like walking on cushions. I have the pink/black, the pink multi, the blue multi, and the grey/black... I highly recommend these shoes. I can't make myself wear anything else.  Every other shoe feels uncomfortable compared to these. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET A PAIR.  YOU'LL COME BACK FOR MORE."
Skechers,Go Walk Joy 15602 Shoe,B071WTWMT4,RL2KZFVLW5IE7,"July 20, 2019",5,Wide feet rejoice,I’m a huge sketcher fan... it my go to brand. I’m a chubby lady with wide Fred flint stone feet. To add insult  I cannot tolerate wearing socks and need a soft stretchy shoe with cushioning that does not have a rough lining  ... these are great ! I love the black soles ... shoes look newer longer compared to white soles. I got the regular width and they work great for my wide feet. They do stretch out after wearing so keep that in mind but I would say true to size.

But these have been the best Skecher shoe I have chosen thus far.  These are very supportive and just cozy and comfortable to switch into after I have been on my feet all day!  I have to wear sneakers for work and when I have to run errands after work or have Bible study to attend or just traveling these are my go to shoes.  I want to order another pair so I don't have to worry about trying to find another kind of Skecher shoe for next summer.

I don’t wear socks with slip on Skechers ever. These are not too big in the heel area as has been the case with many Skechers & have a wide toebox for added comfort. You could easily wear a light weight sports sock with these but I don’t like that look so no socks for me.

I work standing up for long times, anywhere from 8-14 hours and these have been a life saver! During my shorter shifts, i wear these alone and my feet do not hurt.

They run a bit big, however, I’ve put a lightweight ped-type sock on and it’s taken up the slack as I believe a half size down would be too small.  I have bunions and they do not push against them.  I own 10 pairs of different Skechers, most with laces, and these are great for slipping on and off quickly, using in the yard and around the house."

I don’t usually wear tennis shoes style shoes because I think they look strange with leggings (what I live in) but the fact that they don’t have laces makes them work. I will say if you are between sizes, I would go with the bigger size. Definitely worth the buy and the seller got them to me quickly. I would buy again!"

These shoes fit well but the fabric is very flimsy and offers no side support at all.  These are NOT like the other Sketchers I have purchased.  I am keeping them but only because my others are worn out. I wish Sketchers were ALL of equal quality but THEY AREN’T!
Skechers,Women's Go 4-14918 Walking Shoe,B01MY8A9QB,R23FQCN1DDF7FY,"February 25, 2018",5,Comfortable shoe for short walks.,"I usually get my sketchers in a 9. I think because of the material it was slightly larger and slips off when I walk. When I wear with a sock it’s much better. I have to say I am an 8 1/2. So I would recommend to get your actual size in this type of shoe. It is more of a knit material. They are comfy, I mostly bought them just to walk my dog. I have plantar fasciitis so I can’t wear these for too long. They do not have the memory foam so don’t have that extra cushioning. I do like them though."

I have about 4 pairs of Skechers in different styles and have not been disappointed with the comfort or the fit.

I have a bad knee and wearing these caused extreme pain that only went away when I stopped wearing them. Tried again, pain came back. I'm pretty sure there is just not a good enough support with these shoes. They're very attractive and I love how they fit. They are comfortable, but for walking around with my bad knee they just aren't good. The reason I gave 2 stars is because I don't think a shoe should cause pain like this, should be better made."

Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Solace Walking Shoe,B01MU17BVI,RBQC9OANOZM23,"August 15, 2017",2,Odd fit and gave me a disadvantage on Stealth rolls.,"Weird fit. I'm either a 7.5 or 8 in women's shoes, so I ordered a pair of these in both sizes. The 7.5 were too small and squeezed my toes, but the 8 were too loose and my heels would pop out when I walked. Also, both pairs of shoes made fart noises with each step! Nope, I'm not joking. How am I supposed to sneak past my enemies in these?? I had originally planned on keeping the smaller pair, thinking they'd eventually stretch a bit, but there's no way I'm keeping shoes that make fart noises whenever I take a step. Too bad, because they are cute af."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Solace Walking Shoe,B01MU17BVI,R3S23R7MMBKK6M,"January 19, 2018",5,Support with a great look,Love these. I'm 8 months pregnant and needed more support for work.  I work in a business setting and didn't want to wear tenna shoes with work pants. These are cute and look like ballet flats. And I don't have to bend down to tie them!
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Solace Walking Shoe,B01MU17BVI,R305DBN0YTDCY1,"June 18, 2017",4,"Flats, with a Twist","Very comfortable slip-ons with the Skecher quality I've come to appreciate.  I find that I grab these to run errands or just keep a pair for the house.  Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when you first put them on, they're just a wee snug in the toe box.  However, I just put on a semi-thick pair of socks, walk around for a little while, then put them back on (without the socks).  Perfect! I now have a total of four pairs.  The gray is beautiful (has a very slight tint of blue, which makes it a not-so-boring battleship gray color).  I also own several pairs of the Skechers Go Walk.  Love that this brand offers comfort without the heaviness that most walking shoes have, yet are structured. I suspect that these will last quite awhile.  Oh, and washing them is not a problem.  Just toss them in the washer and they come out beautiful (air dry, of course).  These are pretty slip-ons, ladies."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Solace Walking Shoe,B01MU17BVI,RH2D8EED14H7W,"October 20, 2017",4,Very comfortable - think carefully about size,"These are very comfortable - both to wear and to walk in.  They are well made and the soles are substantial, which I wanted for walking and balance.  There is not a lot of arch support or side support, so if you need that these probably are not the shoes for you.  I have calluses on the bottoms of my feet and a hammer toe.  The soles have comfortable foam and there is room enough for my toes with no discomfort (my feet are narrow).  The only issue I had was with the size.  I normally take either a 6.5 or a 7.  I read the reviews and the details from Amazon and the manufacturer and ordered a 7 based on the recommendations.  However, the size 7 was too large for comfort.  They weren't falling off my feet, but they did not feel right either.  If I wore socks I think they would have worked.  I reordered a 6.5 and it was perfect without socks.  I tried insoles in the size 7 pair and that helped immensely.  I ended up keeping both pairs because the size 7 gives me the option to wear socks if I want in colder weather or in case my feet swell up, which sometimes happens. So to sum up, when you are deciding which size to buy think about what you will wear these with as well as whether you have issues with swollen feet.  I also found the material to be a bit stiff at first but it softened up after wearing them.  I like the fact that the material holds its shape when you take them off - sometimes fabric shoes lose their shape and they look worn out and are a pain to put on."

Her feet swell so she needs enough room on the top of her feet and in the toe area. Since the shoe has a large open area on top she can walk without having to wear something that binds her feet. At the same time, the heal doesn't slip. ""Lite"" is the best description of the shoe's weight. I am so please she loves these shoes!

Update* They’re perfect!,"I love the fabric of the shoes and the fact that they are comfortable. However, there was a manufacture issue with the pair of shoes I bought. I am between a size 6 1/2 -7 depending on the shoes. Based on reviews, I ordered a 7. I tried the shoes on and the left shoe fit perfectly but the right shoe was very tight.  It was scraping the top part of my foot (on the edges of the top side of the shoe). I checked the sizes on the inside and they both said 7. As a result, I am returning them. Yet, I liked the shoes so much and bought them again. Manufacture issues always occur. I am keeping my fingers crossed that the next pair will fit perfectly like the left shoe that I tried on. So another review is pending :) New update* I got my new pair of shoes! And they fit perfectly! (size 7) I walked around in them inside my home and did not want to take them off. They are so cute! I can not wait to take them when I travel next month!"

I am disappointed as I have higher expectations about how much I can walk without hurting given the product is marketed as walking shoes."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Solace Walking Shoe,B01MU17BVI,R11VLLM0AOVC2Q,"June 13, 2017",4,Comfortable. Nice style.,"I bought these to replace my GoWalk Skechers. On the pro side, the Go Step Lite is a great style with many color choices. I bought my GoWalk Skechers in the store and they were my normal size of 7 1/2, so that's what I bought online. The heel to toe fit is good, but the narrow shape of the toe area places some pressure on the big toe. A size up might provide more toe room but since the rest of the shoe fits perfectly, I think I would end up with a loose fitting shoe in the heel area. The shoes look nice and work well for going to an event where you would only be walking short distances or you sit most of the time. I would not recommend these for extensive walking (like at a theme park). One other con is that while my feet do not normally sweat, I do find that my feet get sweaty in these shoes."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Solace Walking Shoe,B01MU17BVI,R3OAXIGEHW8H9N,"September 25, 2017",5,Skechers Go Step Women's Shoe/Ballet Flat,"Bought these about a week ago and have worn it almost everyday since. I find them very comfortable. There is enough padding to make walking comfortable. Also, there is plenty of toe space, which is a definite plus point. I also appreciate that I didn't have to break them in as I often do with ballet flats. The only slight complaint is that the back is a little high so it can rub the area above the hell bone/around where the Achilles tendon is. It doesn't bother me or cause me discomfort so i would still recommend this shoe. Remember, this is not a running shoe. It's a comfortable shoe to walk around in or be on your feet in and still look cute."

They were slightly bigger than expected, but not so much that it made a huge difference. The do cut just under my ankle which can be uncomfortable when worn for a lengthy period of time. Be careful when purchasing sketchers slip ons because each style does fit differently."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Solace Walking Shoe,B01MU17BVI,R2ACWZZIFXQ0P1,"September 21, 2018",5,The most comfortable and cute shoes you could hope for!,"These are so comfortable. Originally bought size 6.5 (I usually wear 6.5 or 7), but 6.5 was a little too snug in the toe area, so returned them and got size 7 instead, which were perfect. Purchased to wear on vacation for 3 weeks in France where I knew we would do a lot of walking. These were light and worked great for lots of walking (even on cobblestone streets). They were more comfortable than my running shoes (which gave me a blister, and these did not). Some days we walked more than 5 miles and these remained comfortable the entire time.  On a bus in Paris a French woman commented on how cute they are and asked the brand so she could buy some!"
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Solace Walking Shoe,B01MU17BVI,R1POK4BS2TUEO9,"February 8, 2018",3,Blisters!!!,"The shoes are so cute and the soles are very comfortable.  BUT the sizing is too small.  I usually wear 8.5 although the slide-in style Skechers I have purchased in size 8.  Well, I figured I'd need 8.5 for this enclosed shoe.  It was a bit snug, but I figured it would stretch after wearing a while.  Just walking to my car and then from the parking lot and into the building and the office where I work, I developed huge blisters on both heels.  I spent the rest of the day with the heels of the shoes folded inside the shoe.  I'm very disappointed.  As I said, the soles feel great but the heels really did a number on my feet.  I wonder if going up to a 9 would help, but I'm wary of giving these shoes another try."

They are incredibly comfortable and so simple and neutral I can wear them with anything from shorts to jeans to a dress and still look put-together. I wear them everyday: dog walking, light gardening, shopping, just about anything. And one of the best features is that I can just toss them in the wash with towels and they come out like new. (I air-dry them on a windowsill overnight.)"

But oh my goodness, they STINK.  I wear lots of flats without socks, and sure....over time, they start to smell, and I wash them, nbd.  But these?  They make my feet smell so insanely bad.  And no matter how clean my feet are, how much I try to get the smell out, it comes back within an hour or two.  Again, no issue in other flats (I can literally switch to other flats without washing my feet, and the smell never really comes back in the shoes I switched into).  It makes them pretty much unwearable!"
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Solace Walking Shoe,B01MU17BVI,R1RKIFFKBXRA9J,"July 13, 2019",5,Perfect fit and comfort,I have worn different styles of Sketchers to work every day for the past 6 years and can honestly say that most likely I would have retired 5 years ago had I not discovered these shoes.  My size and width I order consistently fit perfectly without worrying about having to shop in store in order to try them on.  Amazon usually has the better price.
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Step Lite-Solace Walking Shoe,B01MU17BVI,R2VJOS034TN4RJ,"June 1, 2019",1,Walking Comfort,"I've bought other Skechers shoes from you and from Amazon Japan. Those shoes have a lacy top and are very light. The size 9.5 fit, but this time, when I bought black light-solace walking shoes, the size 9.5 was too small, ie., the toes were squeezed and stumped.  I have returned them according to your instructions, and have ordered the same black ones in size 10 which have already arrived and fit well..  When the black size 9.5 arrived and I realized didn't fit, I went ahead and ordered the taupe colored ones in size 10 which arrived since then, and fit.  For senior citizens like myself who have bad knees and need plenty of cushion in the sole but yet want light shoes that look like shoes, I think Skechers does well and addresses our needs.  I hope you will pay attention to orthopedic needs while retaining style and color."

I walk about 4-5 miles a day in my tennis shoes so I did not expect that I would have any issues with these. I felt a pinch on my heel and was annoyed when I thought I had a blister. When I looked down, I realized that my heels were actually bleeding. Extremely disappointed and I can't return them (I bled on the shoes). Oh well."

When I first bought them, they were pretty uncomfortable & tight. After wearing them 3-4 times, they fit absolutely perfect and are my favorite shoes to slip on and go. The only complaint I have is that they smell after wearing them a few times. I’ve washed them and they’re fine for a few more wears before I have to wash them again."

Glad to see Skechers had so many options. I ended up trying these out in the taupe, blue, and black colors, and I kept the black. I work in a business casual (leaning toward business) academic institution, and I just couldn't see myself wearing the blue or taupe with the THICK light colored rubber on the bottom. Felt way too unprofessional. But the black felt just right for that setting (as several reviewers noted). If you work in a casual place, go ahead! If you don't I'd just grab the black ones as they're practical. I'd like to note that the rubber is just way too big, so on petite women like me, beware! Use your best judgement. Size was perfect. I'm usually an 8 and my toes had room! Very comfortable too. I'm sometimes a 7.5 and I know if I got that, it'd be too tight."

Skechers,Women's Cleo-Scalloped Knit Skimmer Ballet Flat,B07J3HLYKG,R1EER6R8FZ0V5C,"October 4, 2019",5,amazing flats,"I was looking for cute flats that were a little less summery (and more structured) than my Sanuk canvas ones. These came up as an alternative when I was searching for Rothys flats and I am so happy to have found them. The knit material gives the red a little texture that makes them interesting without having a print. The upper fabric is flexible enough for the size 10 regular shoes to fit my 10 wide feet comfortably. Despite feeling a little loose when I tried them on, the shoes stay on my feet well and are easy to walk in. The scallop edging make them feel a little offbeat. Even the insole has a star design printed on it. While there isn't a ton of arch support (not something I look for--most of my shoes are almost entirely flat) the insole has some cushioning making them comfortable for walking around where I work and in the subway for my commute."

I love the way they look. I read the reviews and bought mine a half size bigger because some thought the toe box was a bit tight. I am happy that I read the reviews before buying them. I wore them all day and no hurt. I wore them with a dress. I can't wear heels any more. So I am always looking for shoes that can be worn with dresses or with slacks or even Jean's.

These ones might be my favorite though. The memory foam is so wonderful - so they're great to wear to work, but there's also comfortable.

I was thrilled to find these here in black. I find that I am wearing them every day because of comfort and looks and now am debating another beige pair for future use. I was concerned about keeping the beige clean but a damp cloth wipes them easily. The fit is true to size so if your foot is longer do order the next size.

Buying online without trying them on is always a gamble but with Amazon Prime, and the ability to return if it doesn't fit, it is worth it. These shoes are very comfortable. I bought them in White and Black. I usually buy a 9 in athletic shoes so I went with the 9m and they fit perfectly. I have issues with pain in my heels and these shoes have been great with allowing me to be on my feet with little pain. The sole is very cushioned and the shoe fits good enough that my foot is not sliding around or feeling too bound up. I love the pull on aspect and not having to tie them. They are perfect for me."

It's very good to use inside the plane and also in the check in because it's easy to step in and out. It's soft and confy after some months. At the beginning they are too narrow on the toes. What I don't like is that it's too hot in summer, and doesnt breath. The feet wet inside .In winter with socks are great. Also doesn't have a good arch suppor. But it's confortable for walking short distances. And it's beautful .Although not perfect it's a good sneaker to have. I would recomend them and buy them again."

Not so much it bugs me just beware they are true wide width.  I got these because they're cute they look like regular shoes but the memory foam helps with the heel pain I have from sciatica.

Haven't slipped at work in a very wet kitchen, accidentally turned on the hose over my foot and no water seeped through the canvas. They look cute like skate shoes which makes them less dorky before and after shifts and good for waitressing.

The back of the shoe that goes around your ankle is very rough as well as the sole just not having a lot of support. But, they are good non slip shoes and as far as those go, these are some of the better looking ones. So sacrificing comfort for looking good goes with these for sure."

Skechers,Women's Go Walk 5-Lucky Sneaker,B07N13VCL5,R5JYR5QBPKJP0,"November 15, 2019",5,My new favorite work/walking shoes!,"I wear a size 8. I’m 5’7” naturally strong built. I work in a warehouse, so there’s a lot of daily physical activity. I needed new shoes BADLY. I’m on my feet all day. Concrete floors, constantly moving, walking binding, lifting, pushing, pulling, and standing. The pain got so bad, after I settled down from work, it was painful to move. Looking for solutions, I decided to give these a try. After receiving them, tried them on to see how they fit, and feel. It’s the perfect mix of bouncy, & squishy, & stable support. I noticed it instantly upon standing. I love the GOGA insole too! It’s NOTHING like a memory foam insole. It’s more bouncy, like a latex, or a comfy yoga mat that’s been customized for your feet. So they retract more instantly, unlike memory foam. It keeps up with you, with every step. It’s awesome! Had them for a full week, at work, & even while running errands afterwards. My feet are no longer tired, or sore. My lower back, & hip pain has subsided too. I feel more energized during the day.  These are REALLY, REALLY comfortable shoes! I love that they’re washable too. I threw mine in the washing machine, came out clean, without any problems. I’m thinking of getting a second pair for my days off."

The shoe is very comfortable for walking.  I've worn them mostly on an indoor stand-alone elliptical, but have also walked around with these shoes on and they are almost like wearing slippers.  Super lightweight. So, aside from having to go up half a size, I find the shoe very worth the investment.  These are not hiking shoes, but are definitely good walking around shoes or even good for walking for exercise shoes."
Skechers,Women's Go Walk 5-Lucky Sneaker,B07N13VCL5,R132JH0LUVVFAC,"December 17, 2019",5,Most comfortable sneakers I can find,"These are the most comfortable style of Skechers I have owned, and I've had my fair share. They are the goga mat style that I've found to be much more comfortable than memory foam, especially if you walk a lot throughout the day. They are also more comfortable than previous goga mat styles. I also appreciate that these shoes have a classic low-key look that easily matches anything. I seriously love these, I ordered 3 backup pairs for when Skechers inevitably stops making them."

It's not always easy to find a plain navy sneaker and I am so glad Sketchers makes one.  On a recent shoe-buying binge, four out of six pairs I bought were Sketchers, but only because the other two had to be dressy.  I tried on Adidas, Nike  and K-Swiss, but Sketchers are the most comfortable.  They have been my daily shoes for the last several years."

They fit comfortably and very light weight.  I wear them to walk to work everyday as well as work out.  I happened to get caught in more rain than I have before and by the time I got to the bus station I was squishing in my shoes.  Got home and let them dry and they seem to have shrunk.  They are way to to tight now.  Not sure I'll be able to continue to wear them.

Hoping to break them in all the way before 14 hours of walking at Disney in two weeks. *UPDATE* After breaking them in I did wear them at Disney and Universal. They did keep my feet from hurting but were a tighter fit with liner socks. I still wear them today but I'm looking for something a little more comfortable than these are.

Today is my first day wearing, so I'll update later if there are any changes. But my oh my, do they feel like a dream! I would say it feels like I'm walking on clouds, but I think the memory foam is even more comfortable than that. The last time I tried to order sketchers flats, I went with a more ""relaxed"" design that almost fell off my foot with every step. These don't feel like they're going anywhere, but they also aren't too tight. They're also very light. I love them. True to size and the sole is probably just as thick as it needs to be for the amount of comfort. It comes up a little higher on the heel than I'm used to, so there might be a little rubbing as I break them in, but I look forward to wearing these for quite a while."

They are cute, comfortable, and fit nicely with my sweat socks (also have Rheumatoid Arthritis - so bought them a SIZE LARGER TO ACCOMMODATE THEM). I highly recommend them."

They are very comfortable, fashionable at a good price. But this ones i don't want to wear them because they are very narrow at the width area on top of the toes. I thought that they would stretch but no they dont stretch. I wish i could returned them but i alredy used them a few times hoping they would stretch. So if you have EXTRA skinny narrow feet, go for them, they are skechers comfortable. But if you have normal regular width, these are uncomfortable."

Had been trying forever to find a replacement pair for my Skecher Flex shoes that I use for the gym. They're super comfortable but aren't going to last forever! This was as close as I've been able to get to the Flex. Due to severe peripheral neuropathy from chemo drugs, I cannot bear to wear any shoes that fully cover my feet or, God forbid, have laces. Nor do I ever wear sox anymore...jut too painful. (Side note: for our Montana winters, I have a pair of Skechers ankle boots, with good tread on the bottom, that I bought a half size too big. They work great without sox.) The pricing on this Skechers style was excellent, so I'm very happy."

I bought these for my trip to disneyland, but after wearing them for a week to wear them in before I left, they hurt my feet so bad I couldn't take them to disneyland with me. The back heel part is very hard, I wish they put some padding in the heel part to support the heel and not just in the bottom of the foot part. The backs of my heels need padding too! That is the most sensitive part, the part that always gets blisters and it is makes it soo uncomfortable when getting blisters there."

Dirt doesn't seem to stick to the shoes and I'm a gardener, I'm guessing I could pop them into the washer but really spot cleaning would be sufficient.  I usually buy Crocs but they don't always fit correctly and my feet get hot in them, the Skechers slip on well and don't fall off my heals, they have a squeaking issue in the beginning but that has stopped. Note: I thought I would buy a second pair in burgundy but I was shocked to see  the price of the shoe, sold by different companies! $42.00 is a good price for these awesome casual/dressy shoes"

I love this more casual style but when I ordered them in my regular size, they are abit sloppy on my feet.  I added some heel cushions and that seems to have solved the problem.  This particular style has a soft yet sturdy footbed so I have not had to insert arch supports for them to be comfortable."

Every time I take a step they flap like flipflops.  Very annoying and I can't wear them because I'm afraid I'll walk right out of them.  They are too low cut towards the toes so there's nothing to hold them on.  I should've returned them. 8-16-2017 UPDATE-these shoes were driving me crazy not staying on my feet.  I think I might have come up with a solution.  I attached 2 inch wide pieces of elastic with Velcro across the instep to strap them on my feet.  Shouldn't have to do that for what these cute shoes cost.

I ordered these in a 10 and thought they fit great. The more I wore them the looser they got, but only in the heel. Whenever I wore them it felt like it was rubbing up and down my achilles tendon. It didn't give me the usual blister but it ripped up the skin and made it raw on both of my feet. I let that heal thinking I would give it one more go in these shoes. I tried them again today and now have blisters are both sides of both of my feet. I really liked this shoes. They were super comfortable to wear as long as I didn't try to do any sort of walking. I'm quite jealous of the people who don't have any issues with these shoes. I really wanted them to work out. I've never had an issue with any sketchers I've own in the past giving me blisters."

The black color with white sole looks exactly as pictured on Amazon.  I ordered a couple of other Sketcher walking shoes to compare.  I am looking for a lightweight packable shoe to wear with jeans, or travel pants, or black ankle pants during a European vacation that will involved many days of cobblestone walking and sightseeing.  These shoes could meet that need and look cute.  I'm going with a different shoe, but only as a matter of shape and taste. On the foot, these look exactly like a ballet flat with a thick sole.  I just realized I'm not into the ballet flat look. I typically wear a 7.5 medium and these fit exactly as expected in a 7.5. My feet trend toward narrow with skinny back ankle structure and a moderate bunion on my right toe joint.  These shoes did not bind and felt comfortable to walk around in. They were not slipping in the few minutes I tested them.  Also very lightweight and packable."

I'm a hairstylist, so I'm on my feet all day. I was having a lot of foot pain, but when I tried these on it was instantly better. I have wide feet and high arches, so I went up a half size since they're not available in wide. The fabric stretches, so it's ok that they're not wide width, and the soles are wide enough that I'm not walking on the outside of my feet. My only complaint is that the memory foam insoles are thin, so I'm afraid they'll flatten out quickly."

Wore the first pair everyday for more than a year, still comfortable, but tread was finally wearing thin.  The shoe fits well, is comfortable, casual yet dressy, indoors or out.  I washed my first pair a few times, simply squished the shoes in a bucket of soapy water, then rinsed, squished out most of water, let dry and shoes were like new again.  This style is a great casual shoe, indoor or out.  I hope it's still made when my new second pair wears out."

Yes; these do run large. Not really sure why people are complaining, though. I ordered my regular size (6.5 W) and they were too easy to slip off, so I quickly returned them and ordered a size smaller. I am not sure what the big deal is. The return process is no hassle and free of charge ... so, I really don't think it warrants some of these two- and three-star reviews. Anyhow, order a size down from what you usually get and you'll be fine. :D"

I liked the multi-color threads on black. That variety of colors worked with so many casual outfits and so many clothing colors! Unfortunately, they did not work with my 80-lb lab chew monster, so they had an unexpectedly short lifespan. I can't blame that on the shoe at all, just on where I put them down in the house. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find this style and color in my size again to replace them. If I could buy another pair I would. 5 stars for comfort and looks, but one star off for lack of availability."

They fit.,"Have been looking for two years for a casual ballet shoe that fits my WW, high arch, high instep feet which suffer from bunions and plantar fasciitis.  Have ordered many, many shoes from various brands and didn’t find a single pair I could wear.  In desperation I ordered these in wide, feeling they would likely be too tight but I had no options left.  I generally wear a 9WW or 9.5WW but these 9.5W feel good.  There is some bounce in the sole and they look cute.  There is absolutely no arch support.  The heels slip so I need to add heel grips but I’m a happy camper."

I wear these shoes everyday to work because they do not hurt my feet.  I have purchased three of these in the past two years because they are that amazing (and I wear them out quickly because I wear them ALL.The.Time!).  I also recently purchased a pair for my friend at work who is having feet issues.  The memory foam adds enough cushion for my heel, and I feel like I'm walking on clouds.  They are super cute, they look nice with my work clothes, and they allow me to be on my feet 8+ hours a day.  Win, Win!!!"

So I ordered them again, in an 8 and I just got them today.  They are still way too big.  This isn't just a variation in shoe style - the sizing is totally off.  I'm giving up on this shoe!"

I'm a size 6 1/2 and ordered a size 7 juuuuust to be safe (after reading through all the reviewssss), and the shoe fits perfectly. I'm glad I ordered half a size up, the shoes definitely feel like a 6 1/2 than a 7. Strange that these shoes run small, but as long as you're forewarned and informed when you place you're order you should be good to go ahaha. Just order half a size up! I'm happy with the look/design of the shoe, definitely one of the more visually appealing choices from all the non-slip shoes out there in the market. The memory foam insole is 100% removable, so you can choose to replace it with a better insole if you want or just keep it. The laces are kiiinda dorky, but that can easily be replaced with laces of your preference. In the end, they're just work shoes so I'm not worried about it. I work as the bar manager/head bartender at my restaurants bar and get a lot of longggg night shifts constantly standing and runnin' around on my feet. Our restaurant is huge, and the BOH (always got that grease/oil/water on the floor) just about mimics the size of the FOH floor, so I get a lot of walking in! Hopefully these hold up well; My last pair of non-slip shoes (TredSafe) lasted 8 months.. just barely, baaarely holding on for life now LOL-- hence the need for new shoes. I should have replaced my old pair like 2 months ago really :'D I haven't worn this new pair to work yet, but will update on how well they hold up!"

I have had rheumatoid arthritis for 25 years that has primarily effected my feet.  Most shoes I try on for 2 seconds and then say ""NO!"" because they hurt so much.  These felt like a favorite pair I'd owned forever right after I put them on.  In fact, this is my 2nd pair!  I bought my first pair just before a week long trip to Paris, France.  I knew I'd be walking a lot and took a chance by bringing these shoes brand new along with 2 pairs of shoes I had that I knew were comfortable.  Guess what - I never wore the other shoes!  I walked an average of 8 miles a day, with arthritic feet, and I was just fine with these on my feet every day.  I didn't stick out like a tourist either - the all black color of the shoe looks less touristy and more dressy - I've even worn them to work occasionally if I'm having ""a bad feet day"".  If I had to guess I'd say I've walked at least 200 miles in my other pair and they are still holding up well, except for a little wear on the inside liner of the heel.  This pair I bought in reserve for when the first pair wear out -- that's how much I love them!  And I'll be buying more in the future. I initially went to the Sketchers store at the mall to try on many different types, but this style was definitely the most comfy."

But if you want shoes that look like them, go for it.  8/7/19 EDITED to show pictures & additional info: I have worn Skechers exclusively for at least 10 years. I put the new “Skechers” next to my 18 mo old real Skechers. Looking closely, you can see the sole doesn’t have the support of the real ones. You can easily see the lack of foot support. You can see how big the foot opening itself is compared to the opening of the real brand. Notice the elastic strings on top. Even my old shoes look better than the stretched out elastic string shown on the new pair. I think my old shoes look better than the new ones and they’ve got at least 2500 miles on them. It’s had to show all the differences in pictures. The only reason I bought them was bc I forgot my shoes when I left on vacation. Had them delivered to my son’s house just to keep things easy. Needless to say, I had to find a mall and buy shoes. The do not FEEL like Skechers, they do not FIT like Skechers, THEY ARE NOT SKECHERS!!"

I don't really know if shoes can cause arthritis, but these pair will make the bones in your feet tender and achy, especially the joint under the big toe. The footbed is cushioned and it feels deceptively comfortable at first, which is why I wore them out and now can't return them. But there is no support at all. I have never over-pronated but after wearing these shoes I now know exactly what that term means, what over-pronation feels like, and why you need to correct it. These shoes will make your calves tight (since you have to work your feet for stability) and give you a back ache. Ugh. I like Skechers ordinarily. But stay away from these shoes unless you are itching for pain and injury."

They're fine for short walks I guess, but any time I try to walk over a mile at a time, my feet start hurting and I get blisters from them and they've had ample time to be broken in. I hate giving Sketchers a bad review. I've been buying their shoes for years, but these were a real disappointment and I guess I'll be looking for a different pair for my long walks. I have nothing against the brand. Usually they have decent quality shoes at great prices, but these just fell way short of my expectations."

As a diabetic, that's important. I would have expected it to take longer than 6 months for the shoes to start falling apart. The fabric that guards the toe is separating from the stitches that hold it in place. The stitches themselves are great. It's like walking with little wings flanking my toes.

No laces, but fits tight (but not too tight!) without them.  No worries about a slipping heal!  Not too bulky a shape, not too thin.  Size is as it should be, you don't have to buyer larger or smaller than your normal size, for a good fit.  I'd buy this item again!"
Skechers,Women's Go Walk Lite-15430 Boat Shoe,B072NBSBJM,R1KPCZFVK1CAMN,"April 27, 2018",5,Walking on a cloud,"These shoes are amazingly lightweight, even though the soles are very robust. The tread has deep grip, but tapers off on the side for a more classic deck-shoe look. They came with both white and tan shoestrings, so I guess that switching to white would add more contrast. The red fabric uppers have blue undertones... looks great with jeans. Nice contrast stitching. The vamp is medium high, soft and flexible. Did I mention comfortable? Plenty of toe room and support all around the foot. Arch support is better than most shoes of this style, but less than cross-trainers. Overall, a great shoe at a good price."

I've finally found boat shoes that are comfortable. I wanted to try the Sperrys, but those are very expensive, so I didn't. I did try the Clarks that look very much like these, but were also expensive, and were actually comfortable, but which had a strangely sharp edge on the gel insoles along one side in one shoe. I have wide feet with very high insteps, and these fit comfortably in the medium width. They don't have high arch support, but the squishy insoles alleviate that somewhat. I don't think I'd wear them for a long hike, but they're perfect for wearing all day with moderate walking. They are very light weight, also."

They are beyond comfortable. I plan to buy more when they go on sale again. I almost wish I could sleep in them, they are that comfy. It's like walking on pillows. At first I thought they were a bit long, and maybe could have gone with 1/2 size down, but after wearing them a couple of days they are amazing as they are and my foot doesn't slide around. The tongue sits higher on the top of my foot than the Clarks boat shoes I tried, even though comfort was almost the same. Cost was better with the Sketchers sale at the time. Try these."

I have wide feet.,I was surprisingly shocked and delighted that these shoes are so comfortable and are such a great fit. I am a person who has a hard time finding shoes. I have very wide feet that have widened even more after the birth of both my children. Even though I could technically wear an 8 to a 9 most of the time in shoes I have to buy a 10 because of the width. With these I bought a 9.5 and expected to probably have to return them. Most boat shoes have a narrow width. I had previously owned a pair of Sketcher boat shoes probably 10 years ago and I had to spend a lot of time breaking them in before they got comfortable. With these shoes they were comfortable right away I wore them all day today without socks they did not run a blister. If I had any complaints it would be that they don't offer the best support when walking long distances. I personally don't mind feeling like I'm walking barefoot I actually prefer that but I could see where some people might want some better support. All in all I'm a very satisfied customer and very happy with these shoes.

These shoes fit a tad loose the first time I put them on but nothing too significant. After wearing them all day I noticed the shoe gets even more loose. They also make lots of noise on tile floors indoors. They sound like wet sneakers on tile even when they are bone dry. It's weird? You dont hear it when on carpet or concrete. The cushion feeling when you walk is nice. I'm on my feet all day and my feet dont hurt at the end of the day. I reccomend buying a half a size down. (Or try them in a store first, just beware they may stretch-out/loosen even more after you wear them.)"

I wear these casually and at my job (I have to dress nice but don't have to dress exceptionally professionally).  I think they are really cute, but my first pair faded after having to walk through wet grass on more than one occasion.  These are very comfortable- I would say they have been one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I've had.  I can wear these at work and not have sore feet by the end of the day as opposed to some of my other shoes.  I actually have 3 pairs- bought my first pair, asked for a second pair for my birthday (just to have for when the first pair wears out), and right after that they dropped the price so I bought a 3rd pair that I didn't really need- but I have them for later.  My first pair was a pair of 6 and they are a little snug but they stretched with my feet and didn't really cause me any discomfort.  I have gone ahead and wore a pair of the 6.5 and they are a little roomier for my feet but not too big.  So far even my first pair haven't worn out yet (other than being faded), so they seem to be well made.  Overall I would recommend these."

So when they became a little ragged and worn out, I looked to Amazon to find a replacement since they weren't available in the store any more.  These do not quite match up to the original pair I had.  While still very comfortable, the bottom sole and inner padding is very different.  The ""leather"" part of the shoe isn't to the same standard as the original as well.  If I hadn't already had a pair, I wouldn't know the difference, would assume these were authentic Sketchers, and would enjoy them as such. And as I said, they are comfortable and I'll continue to wear them, but they're just not quite the same overall quality as the first pair I bought."

I would describe these shoes as clumpy but utilitarian.  They're not pretty, but they're super comfortable.  The material is not leather but vinyl. I wanted a pair of supportive vinyl shoes to use as barn shoes.  Because they're vinyl and meant for food service, they are water repellent.  I walked through a few small puddles and no issues at all. They slip on easily and don't slide off.  Sizing fits as expected.  One thing I love about Skechers is that you almost always wear the same size across styles, and the same is true for these shoes."

My original pair of shoes are no longer available so I decided to try this brand and style. In full disclosure, I did not break these shoes in before my first shift. I broke these shoes out for an 8 hour bar shift and before I could leave the house my feet were hurting which was sign number one. I falsely assumed that it would get better after a couple of hours and once I got busy I would not notice. I was sadly mistaken. Half way through my shift, my feet were aching mercilessly and I was miserable. I couldn't sit down and I could not stand still. By the time my shift ended and I was ready to walk out for the night, I couldn't feel my feet, my knees were hurting, and my back was aching. If your feet have ever really hurt, you know how it takes down the rest of your body. I came home and soaked in Epsom salt for an hour and went to bed. It took 2 full days for my feet to stop hurting! I was not pleased at all. I have another bar shift tomorrow night (5/9/19) for 5 hours. I am going to give these shoes a second chance and update my review. I can tell you now if I have to buy insoles for brand new ""comfort"" shoes, I will not be a happy person."

Shoes were comfortable and safe (I often walk on wet floors).  I have been wearing them for about a month when the front of shoe began digging into my ankle.  It may be because I was wearing thinner socks and the shoe was slipping back when I walked.  I will wear again with thicker socks to see if that is the problem.  The manufacturer may want to lower the front of the shoe or shape it to allow more room.  Otherwise great shoe.

Shoe size 9.5, wide, does not accommodate a wide foot. I purposely got a size larger so could slip on easily.  Not to be. I wasn't strong enough to pull the shoe apart enough to get it on.  Looks like once you got it on, it might be very comfortable, except for design of the back (top) of shoe still would touch your foot while wearing. Seems like it should slope away from the foot -- not into it,. The front part of the shoe looked very wide and comfy -- & I liked the shoe heel height. Much better than flat shoe for my needs.

I love them so much that I ordered a second pair two days after receiving my first pair. I only wish that I had not listened to several of the reviews (after reading many) saying to order a half size smaller than you normally wear. I ALWAYS buy an 8 in shoes  pretty much across-the-board with any shoe type. I listened to the reviews and ordered a 7 1/2. Yes, they fit, that is with a bit of a struggle to get them on. I can see how they are going to stretch out after wearing them, but not enough to have ordered a size down. Not to mention I don't like that it will be a struggle to get my feet in them every time I put them on and it is a snug fit. When the size 8's I bought fit perfectly and  are so comfortable. I am pretty sure my big toe is going to end up sticking out, which is not a problem I have with any other pair of my shoes. I'm not going to return them because I hate returning stuff and going to that hassle but, I hope this helps others and you listen to my advice and order your true size. The shoes are absolutely adorable and so comfortable. I love the memory foam in them! It's a truly awesome feature. I will probably be wearing these shoes all summer. They come in so many different colors and different design patterns. I plan on ordering 1-2 more pairs (IN A SIZE 8)...that's how much I like them, but please, please, please listen to me and order your ""everyday"" size. I do not have any idea why several people wrote in their review to order a half a size smaller, because in doing so it messe me up. I knew this when I tried the 7 1/2 on out of the box, but when I got my second pair in a size 8 my ""normal size"" and tried them on, I REALLY knew for sure. I hope this helps! I never write reviews…BUT I felt very strongly about this. There's nothing more frustrating than when you are excitedly waiting on newly bought pair of shoes or whatever and they don't fit right. Especially when you order a half a size smaller based on reviews when you never ever do that...I am making it a new habit to write reviews. I spent a lot of my time and money on Amazon shopping and I feel that my Opinion could be super helpful…Let me know if you take my advice and agree with me;-)"

I was a little worried about buying these after reading the reviews about the fit. Most of them were saying to buy a half size smaller than normal. Others complained about how they slip off the heel when walking. I decided to give them a try but I knew I didn't want to get a shoe that was too small so I got my normal size. They arrived today. I pulled them out of the box and put them on. They look and feel fantastic. The memory foam is so amazingly comfortable!  Then I started to walk and sure enough, they slipped off my heel. Ugh! I love these shoes. I want these shoes but I can't wear them if they won't stay on my feet when walking. Then I had a brainstorm. The shoes fit perfectly when I'm not moving. The soles are very stiff. They don't allow the shoe to flex. So I took matters into my own hands. I took each shoe off and forced them to bend. It wasn't much. Like I said, the soles are really stiff but, I did what I could. Then, I put the shoes back on and started to walk again. Just like magic, no more slipping! The shoes fit just like they should and they stay on my feet. I couldn't be happier!  To those of you having trouble with ""slippage,"" don't waste your money on heel guards. Just manually force your soles to flex. You'll be glad you did!"

I had no idea when I purchased them, but now that I know, I will purchase more (and encourage my friends and family to do the same). The interactive 'shoe sizing guide' is a plus, and definitely helped because I was trying to decide between a 7 and a 7.5 and the 'recommendation' ended up being correct. Not only are they super cute and comfortable (the memory foam inside is divine), but I can also feel good about the purchase and have zero guilt about buying more!

The shoes don't bend, it's like I tied two bricks on my feet. Since you can't bend them when you're walking, your gait is weird so you end up hating them.

Skechers,BOBS from Skechers Women's Highlights Flexpadrille Wedge,B01N21YO39,R2PV8XGJDPDW06,"July 11, 2019",3,Most comfy shoes but...,"I really like these shoes. I will say that the right shoe is not as comfy as the left but that is my anatomy. The arch of my foot is higher on the right so it feels tight on the top of my foot. Again, that is my problem not the shoe maker. I also have heel spurs which is why I bought these for the memory foam insoles and they have helped greatly! No other shoes including my Nike tennis shoes or my addidas tennis shoes with gel inserts or my Nike padded flip flops even come close to these. There are two downfalls. First is that the first time I wore them, the rubber sole part detached a bit from the bottom of the sole. The good thing is that I think a bit of Shoe Goo will be able to fix it. I ordered some so we'll see. The second down fall is that they are canvas. They stain easily (I have the natural color) and it is impossible to clean ones they get dirty. For this reason, I am very careful with them and I keep all of my shoes in separate plastic shoe boxes in my closet. I hope that will help them last longer. I also bought the Van's shoe spray for my kids shoes and sprayed my Bob's. It has really helped with my kid's shoes, better then other brands. If all fails, I have a pair of black ones too so I'll keep buying them in darker colors. I see a lot of comments about the espadrille part coming apart. I haven't had mine long enough to know if that will happen but if it does, I'll trim and re-glue it on if I have to."

The Bobs have a nice soft heel back, so no problems there! I read through the reviews recommending ordering a half size smaller. I'm so glad that I didn't listen. I ordered in my regular 7.5 and they were just long enough with some room to stretch. Any smaller, I would not have been able to get my foot in. They will stretch a little and I did use a shoe horn to get them on the first several times. They were tight but will stretch. But the memory foam in the shoe is delightful and I can wear these all day with no problems. These look great with jeans or sundresses!"
Skechers,BOBS from Skechers Women's Highlights Flexpadrille Wedge,B01N21YO39,R3E6SRDKG3GH1P,"November 12, 2019",5,I just adore these shoes.,"I really like these casual, super-comfortable espadrilles, which I wear as my indoor “slippers” (because they feel good on the feet, even if I throw them on without socks—*not* because they wouldn’t hold up as regular outdoor shoes—I think they certainly would). Size: I was initially a tad concerned because they felt a bit small for the size I ordered [an 8, I think?].  I wasn’t concerned for long, though, because the nice/sturdy-but-comfortable fabric stretched to fit my feet perfectly. Care: I have even tossed these into the washer (cold cycle) and then briefly into the dryer (after I had to dash outside with them on, in the rain/mud, when I almost forgot my younger kiddo had an early-release school day)—and the shoes came out of the dryer just fine out. They did very well (no shrinkage or fraying—but I’d recommend not washing them often of course, just in case. Only small issue: These have a not-*that*-tall platform bottom, which I like very much—provides just enough of a boost for this 5’5” woman. The only thing, though, is you may want to be careful not to—I don’t know —run wildly to get a kid at a bus stop, or jump around a whole lot with that little kid inside, because one of my (generally strong) ankles sort of “gently collapsed/wobbled outward” a couple times, though the platform isn’t high enough to cause a “twisted” or sprained ankle—just a momentary bit of concern (at least for me). So, again I *really, really* like these, and if you’re in the market for espadrilles to wear in weather that’s a lot warmer than we have going here right now, or as a neat pair of “slippers” for indoor use, I have no trouble highly recommending these for you!"
Skechers,BOBS from Skechers Women's Highlights Flexpadrille Wedge,B01N21YO39,R15MAOWM4VCNLG,"August 16, 2017",5,Very comfortable,"These shoes are so comfortable. I originally bought the tan ones in 7.5 and they were a perfect fit, but when I bought the black they were too small and sent them back for a half size larger and they fit perfectly like the tan ones. I guess the black material ""rule"" is the same for shoes. If you buy anything in black order bigger in clothing and in shoes. Black material items will always be smaller. Return shipping was a breeze and I received my new shoes lightening fast, Thanks Amazon!!! Love the free shipping and free returns. As for all the complaints about slipping in the back of the shoe. ANY clog type shoe will have that, it's not really a problem unless you buy the wrong size. When I bought the tan ones, the other reviewers said they ran big so I bought a half size smaller, I usually wear an 8 so 7.5 was a perfect fix, except for the black ones which I guess would be true to size."

I love that it has a little wedge and not as flat as some of the other shoes by this maker.  I did end up having to return them because they slipped off the back of my foot and rubbed my heel.  I thought about getting a gripper for the heel but those things never work for me.  I also have one foot slightly wider then the other one so although I know the shoe would stretch a little bit it was a tiny bit uncomfortable straight out of the box.

These came up as an alternative when I was searching for Rothys flats and I am so happy to have found them. The knit material gives the red a little texture that makes them interesting without having a print. The upper fabric is flexible enough for the size 10 regular shoes to fit my 10 wide feet comfortably. Despite feeling a little loose when I tried them on, the shoes stay on my feet well and are easy to walk in. The scallop edging make them feel a little offbeat. Even the insole has a star design printed on it. While there isn't a ton of arch support (not something I look for--most of my shoes are almost entirely flat) the insole has some cushioning making them comfortable for walking around where I work and in the subway for my commute."

These are SO comfortable. I bought them to traipse around Europe. Day 2 of cobblestone, steep hills, and a few dirt paths, and my feet feel great!

They arrived in a plastic envelope wrapped tightly around the shoe box, perfectly as if someone was gift wrapping it, no joke. The box was undamaged. The shoes were a big stiff getting my foot in the opening, but once they were on they were very comfortable. Not tight, or hurting my feet at all. Even though they are made of a stronger mesh, breathable material, it is strong. So it did not make my feet feel like they were sliding about in the shoe. It held my feet in place even when I was chasing my dog. The only thing I noticed was for a size 10, they were a little shorter from heel to toe in size than other size 10 shoes I bought, so my toe was a lot closer to the end of the shoe than it normally would be and I had no socks on at the time. But they still fit very well! I would not return them for this. If I had to buy them again, I would probably buy a half size larger to accommodate wearing socks, maybe a full size larger if wearing thick socks for winter. I walked my dog for 4.4 miles today after they arrived. I did not experience any feet swelling, aching feeling in my heel, arches or calves when I got back home, like I normally would in my other shoe I had. I will try to update in a couple of weeks and see how they are still working out. One other thing, they are a very attractive looking shoe!  I believe my 14 yr old daughter will snatch these shoes from me like she did my last pair of mesh type shoes I bought. Only difference is, I know she won't be giving this one back like she did the other. HAHA."

Very disappointed and now that I’ve worn them I know they can’t be returned or refunded."

I’ve tried orthotics and what I call “Minnie Mouse” style (& very expensive) orthopedic  shoes, but I keep coming back to Skechers for my day to day shoes. In the various GoWalk styles, I feel better balanced and far more comfortable than any other shoe on the market. Love the print and color combo of this shoe. My only complaints are that they don’t offer a wider range of colors and prints - and I wish they offered a dressier, less casual looking shoe that had the same sole/footbed and lift ratio from toe to heel. The ballet style Skechers currently offers do not feel as well balanced on my feet; they are just too flat."

I have several pairs of Sketchers and always wear them without socks and never have had this problem before. They are really cute and I wanted to wear them on my upcoming vacation but they just didn't work out for me. I wear a size 7 and am rather petite (5""), so maybe it has something to do with my height? Also, I wore them for about 30 minutes and the bottom of the soles got dirty right away.

They're nearly perfect length wise, but are bordering on too big width wise.  It's not so much that they're slipping at the heel or that I'm thinking about sending them back, but it really makes me wonder about how Skechers has chosen to size this line.  I have feet that are on the wide side, yet these shoes are extremely roomy.  I can't imagine how anyone with a narrower foot can get by with these.  You'd run out of room in the toe before you found a small enough size to fit the width of your foot. That said, these are really really comfortable shoes.  Lots of cushion and decent support, and require no breaking in time.  I haven't done any serious walking in them yet, but if they're as good as my previous pairs of Go Walk shoes, they should be great."

I will soon be 71 and live on 4 1/4 acres with no paved driveway or walkway to the house, so a lot of dirt gets tracked in no matter how careful I am.  If I take my shoes off when I first come in to avoid tracking dirt in, and go barefoot or use my regular slippers, it aggrevates my knees if I'm on the kitchen tile or main area hardwood for very long. I decided to order these because they had great reviews and I thought they would protect my knees if I'm on my feet in the house very much. They arrived today and as I slipped my foot into them I literally said out loud ""Oh my gosh!"" because they felt so very comfortable.  These are far and away my favorite Skechers to date.  They are soft under my feet, fit comfortably and no stitching around the tops to aggrevate my toes.  I absolutely love them.  If I could give them ten stars, I would."

I wore them yestrday for the first time and as a frequent foot cramp sufferer I expected the worst but these shoes are so comfortable I had no foot cramps even after wearing all day.  This is my 4th pair of Skechers go walk and these are my favorites.  However! The sizing is weird on these so buyer beware.  I always wear a size 6 in all my shoes including all previous 3 pairs of Skechers so I ordered a 6.  I had to return as they were too big- literally loose on my feet.  I exchanged for a 5.5 and they are perfect so you may want to consider a half size down.  I gave a four stars for the inconvenience of having to return but for the shoe itself once it’s sized right it’s awesome.

But this has a design problem. The shoe is entirely synthetic and contains a foam insole that has not been treated to retard germ growth.  Therefore, it quickly holds sweat and dirt inside the shoe and under the insole. After a while, it retains odors which imbed into the synthetic fibers and hollow chambers of the shoe. In short, it begins to smell and is very hard to clean.  Frequent Washing helps, but that deteriorates the shoe.  I have tried several pairs and find the best solution is to keep the shoe dry and to wear socks.  I do not have a foot odor problem, but after wearing this pair in wet grass, the shoe developed a stench and had to be discarded."

These are very very stiff, don't even think about wearing without socks.  May even get blisters with socks.  Doesn't stretch, foot is cramped.  Memory foam is either thinner or lower quality than in the past.  Very very flat, no arch support and may experience foot tendon strains not like in the past.  My theory on why people are rating this high is that Skechers changed up the materials to save $$ and kept the name.  Also, they made the tong longer so you have to bend down to get the shoe on, not really a slip on.  Horrible.  Anyone know of a shoemaker that makes the old style soft and thick foam slip ons?"

These shoes fit more like an 8 - so much so that I had to double check the inside of the shoe to make sure that they weren't in the wrong box.  And they are definitely NOT a relaxed fit, far more like a narrow shoe.  They'll be going back today as they are just too small for my big pods.  They would be very comfortable if I could get them in a size that fits.  Lots of support, very flexible, stylish enough to wear to work.  If you have smaller feet, give them a try.

Usually I use a 9B, but am a bit narrow as compared to B (recently not narrow enough for N). In a local store was able to try on and found insole to be soft and accommodating. Toe was lined with a firm facing to prevent toenail from popping through fabric upper. But at that point (great/big toe) it felt a bit tight. If I went to 9.5, the heel could be too loose and slippery. I ordered the 9B in charcoal online, and during the first wearing, the heel edge was sharp and digging into skin. Barely avoided a bad blister. The toe still is a bit restrictive but hoping it will expand with wear. Plan to use a heel pad or dressing for second try. Maybe see if someone can stretch the heel edge a bit. Not entirely happy yet, although this seemed at first to be a comfy and attractive casual shoe. Glad I didn't spend more."

This style has a firmer sole than the super-flexible Skechers norm.  This style also has a ""relaxed fit.""  I loved this style and the firmer sole, but unfortunately, ""relaxed fit"" + less flexible sole + slip-on style = heels slipping out of the shoes.  Going down a half-size might have worked but Skechers doesn't make a 10.5 size.  It's a very nice shoe if you can find the right size for you."

The 8 fit perfectly and felt fine when I tried it on, just as it had in the store. I embarked on a trip. One short flight later, I couldn't even walk through the airport. I had a blister on one heel where the top of the shoe cut in. Fortunately I had a second pair of shoes in my carry-on and I had to change right there in the airport between flights. I gave those shoes away as they were not worth taking up suitcase space. Funny, I had tried them in gray at another local store, and those just killed my heel immediately, so I didn't buy them.

I definitely suggest you order 1/2 size smaller shoe if you want your heel to touch THE very back of the sneaker.  If 1/2 an inch doesn’t bug you and / or your feet swell, I would suggest you order your typical size (consider how small 1/2” actually is?).  If you plan to wear socks with these sneakers order your regular size.  Since the insole is memory foam, the soles of my feet will warm and settle in the sneaker, so it’s all good!

Purchased as supportive ""slippers"" for inside house use only. Dislikes: Have not even had these shoes for a month yet and they're already breaking down. I have ONLY worn them inside my home and can't believe they're already falling apart."
Skechers,Women's Commute-Knitastic-Engineered Knit Open Back Mule,B079HM8KKF,R3OI99PY0JHXCV,"July 11, 2019",4,"Love this shoe, but it runs a size larger than labelled","I've always worn a size 5.5 in Sketchers sneakers, but this shoe fits a size bigger than usual. Very happy with the construction and comfort quality. This shoe is very comfortable for wear around the home and short trips out. It has too little arch support, less than other Sketcher's shoes that I have owned, and therefore wouldn't be one that would stand up to long hours of standing or walking. Decided to keep the bigger size as I experience pedal edema (swelling of the feet) frequently. Bought these to replace my 15+ year old pair of Sketchers Bike style shoes! Love the black with rainbow stitching that I choose as they don't show pet hair. Breathable too! I would highly recommend these shoes for a comfy slip on that goes from house shoe to wear out anywhere casually. Just order at least a 1.2 size smaller than you would expect to for a tighter fit or to wear without socks."
Skechers,Women's Commute-Knitastic-Engineered Knit Open Back Mule,B079HM8KKF,R31YK1ZTQWV2SD,"January 26, 2019",5,Easy and comfortable. Seriously a pregnant woman’s best friend in the 3rd trimester.,"I was needing a pair of shoes to easily slip into, and be comfortable as my pregnancy was causing my feet to swell and making it harder to bend down and put on other shoes. These were perfect. As soon as they came in, I slipped them on and it was like walking on clouds compared to my keds and comfy ankle boots (the only two pairs that I could just slightly fit into currently). I wore them for my busy day and for once my feet did not feel fatigued when I got home. So glad I purchased these! I’m not one to buy sketchers but the strechty material helps with the swelling and the memory foam conforms to my foot and my high arches. If you are looking for something easy and comfortable to wear, look no further!"

And perhaps that's the reason I don't like these much--they don't fit without heavy socks and even with heavy socks they are still very sloppy and wide. They also seem a bit long too. I have a moderate heel and you could pracically get both my heels in one shoe at the back. They toe box isn't as bad, but it's still a W not an M width I was expecting. Usually Sketchers are relatively narrow, so I was surprised. Maybe only bad in larger sizes? What they are is super comfortable, easy on and off shoes, but because of the width, they are more like clogs than sneakers."
Skechers,Women's Commute-Knitastic-Engineered Knit Open Back Mule,B079HM8KKF,R1XLOV8JM9GNYI,"May 18, 2019",4,"Sketcher’s full sneakers remain narrow, but their slip on styles fit very large.","Since I have very high arches...at some point in life....those of us with very high arches find they have fallen quite a bit. It would have been nice if there would have been more arch support. And, with fallen arches, previously narrow feet become wider. Since most Sketchers seem to run fairly narrow by design, I expected to do what I normally do, order a half size up. But I am finding that, with the open back (mule) slip on style, this shoe is very WIDE ( and my feet even swell ). My advice would be to consider ordering your regular size whenever you get a Sketcher shoe of this style. I do love the slip on style, it’s just way too roomy width wise."

The color is off what was pictured here but I don`t mind (refer to the photos I posted.) They are comfortable to walk/bike/stand in. However, I live in the tropics and these make my feet incredibly hot. Sort of like winter sneakers. They work fine for when I have blisters from wearing other shoes and need an open-end mule. I would probably not order them again. I had this type of shoes from Payless shoes before and they were much better despite being half price. For some reason, I just do not ""feel"" these shoes exactly. They are also sort of  ""cute"" if you will but aren`t the prettiest and make my feet look longer than they should."

Skechers,Women's Easy Going Repute Mule,B00NORCAA4,R1WVFM04SHYF47,"July 16, 2016",5,Shoe Eutopia,"I have been shopping for a easy on comfort shoe since spring. I purchased many well-made brands but couldn't get the right fit. I have a high arch and my feet are wide at the toes. Plus, as I am getting older, my feet just hurt at the end of a long day. Every pair had either too little or no arch support, or they squished my toes together which gives me ingrown toenails, or they were just uncomfortable. Finally I figured I would give these are try. They were pure comfort from the first time I wore them. I didn't even have to put my orthotic insoles in them because they had enough support. Also, for a mule-type shoe, they stay on your feet when walking. I will be looking for new colors to purchase this shoe in. Totally love them."

Due to medical issues and mobility challenges, I have purchased over a dozen other pairs of similar shoes (Keen, Merrill, UGH, Easy Spirit and Sketchers), and these Sketchers Easy Going Repute Mules are the absolute best I've found!  The only other shoe that comes close is a Merrill mule (which I paid $110.00 for!). I realize shoes are a very subjective purchase, particularily for those of us who, for a variety of reasons, can't just wear ""any type"" shoe. I know that a $110.00 shoe will be hard to compare to a shoe that costs less than half that amount, but I am pleased to say this shoe really does.  It is true to size and width, and is comfortable with or without socks. I just purchased my 2nd color, and will get the other colors as soon as my budget allows. I could not be more pleased with these; I just hope they don't discontinue them!"

They are lightweight and very comfortable. I should mention I was at first thrown off by the light weight. These are not rubber soles, they are synthetic and therefore light weight.

I used a hairdryer to warm up the glue and continue pulling and they finally came off. I inserted my orthotics in them and the original glue kept my orthotics in. I hope the shoes will last long because of my expensive orthotics. I wore them on easy hiking trails, walking even went to the beach with them. They are so comfortable. I really love them."

They were comfortable from the moment I put them on and through my whole shift. I did find they ran a little big. But I think that's because I am not used to the ""mule""style. I stopped on the way home and bought a thick memory foam insole and that did the trick. But the insole of the shoe was already great.

The current Skecher mule sold in the stores is not very comfortable, nor does it have much stability for a flat footed person. That is why I love this slide-on.  It has a thick layer of memory foam and the toebox area is not too large. It does take about a week of wearing this shoe to break it in to your foot, but other than that it is perfect. Thanks Amazon seller for having this available for me. I have been searching for a black pair for months. Also, as for sizing, this mule does run larger/longer than normal. So, I normally wear a 9 1/2, but in this shoe in a 9 fits perfectly."

I went to a local shoe store and tried them on and then ordered them here.  As other reviewers have said, the shoe sizes really differ.  I normally wear a size 7.5 and ended up getting a 7 in these.  I also tried on the Go Walk Pursuit, but the 7.5 was too big and the 7 too small.  When the package arrived I wore them around the house for a little while and loved the way my feet sank into the Goga Max insole.  Then I wore them for a few hours, and I started to think “these shoes aren’t really that comfortable.”  The more I walked the more my heels started to hurt, and it continued to get worse until I took them off, and had to prop up my feet so nothing could touch my heels.  It is the worst pain I have experienced in the two years since Plantar Fasciitis-like heel pain began.  After taking a look at the shoes the next morning I realized it was because there is a “Goga Pillar” that presses right into the tenderest spot of my heels.  Needless to say, I am returning them.  Anyone with Plantar Fasciitis/heel pain should reconsider before ordering these shoes."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 4 - Achiever Walking Shoe,B01AH022NK,R8NC35UA380BY,"June 25, 2017",2,Extremely disappointed,"I love Skechers and have come to appreciate the brand for the quality and the wide width shoes that actually fit my feet and make walking comfortable. I needed a new pair and decided to try a pair of these walking shoes due to the terrific reviews. The reviews were way off and I was really disappointed in these shoes. When I first tried them on, they were comfortable, but after wearing them twice, I could tell the cushion was already wearing down. It does not offer a lot of support to begin with and does not contour to your foot like Skechers Go Run. In fact, the inside is flat. I think the round things on the sole are supposed to offer some type of support when you walk, but I don't feel it. After the first few times of wearing these, they stretched out and now they flop off of my foot. They fit perfectly when I first tried them on. I even started to wear thicker socks, but they still flop. On the back of the ankle, there is a raised portion of the shoe that pokes into that are of my foot. This is terrific - especially when the shoes is flopping back and forth while walking. I will go back and see if the Go Run brand has changed, or if it is still the same quality as what I purchased before. I do not recommend these for power walking or any type of exercise walking.

I do wish they would quit changing ...,"This is my sixth, seventh? pair of GoWalks. I love them. I do wish they would quit changing the styles though. The original GoWalks fit my foot perfectly. Subsequent iterations have narrowed the toe box so I have to order wides now. That leaves the heel too wide for me so I have quite a bit of movement in the back of the shoe. I said ""fit as expected"" because I knew this would be the case for me in particular. I walk 2 to 3 miles every morning before breakfast so I wear shoes out. These are my ""go to"" shoe when hurrying out the door."

I buy 2 pair of Skechers Go Walk shoes each year. I bought these because the soles seem a little more durable than my previous Go Walks. The only issue is that the fabric is not as soft and stretchy as the other ones. The back part of the shoe did rub the back of my ankle causing a blister. I could not get it to soften up, so I cut the part off that caused the issue and put a few stitches in to hold it together. They are perfect for me now. Even with the issue I had, I would buy these again. The soles give me a little more support."

My size 9 Wides fit, but weren't as comfortable as the double wides I ordered after the first pair gave out from too much walking, gardening, and basically destroying them. (I mean destroyed!

The first pair was the first generation of Go Walk and after 2 years, the canvas started ripping and I wore a different shoe for a couple years.  The first Go Walks I still have and wear as slippers and the soles are still in tact.  A year and a half ago I bought this shoe and it really helped my planters fasciitis and hip issues.  After a year there was a hole in the bottom on the sole.  I decided to buy the same pair about 6 months ago so I would ha w a pair without holes.  They lasted 3 months and I noticed if it rained, my feet would get a little wet.  I thought it was the canvas.  Nope, large hole in the bottom.  I want to give these 4 or 5 stars, but I the quality seems to have gone down and it’s past the point where I could exchange them.  They are fine if I wear them inside only, and in the winter I will, but it has been so rainy so it’s super inconvenient to have to bring back up shoes with me everywhere."

They were too large when they arrived, but I figured with a good sock, it would be fine, however, the shoe has simply gotten bigger and bigger as I have worn it.  The sole is full of holes which holds every rock you might step on.  So you won't be doing any walking unless you are ALWAYS on a paved surface.  If you step on any rock, it will be stuck in the sole.  Had I not thrown out the box, they would be going back.  And they are absolutely ugly.

My feet need orthotics  and support but these shoes are very comfortable, and have replaced slippers. This is a follow up.  These new sketchers are NOT like the older version.  They fit tight, there is no support, they hurt my feet and cause my knees and legs to ache.  This new version feels like cheap shoes from Dollar General,  or the like.  I am very disappointed and want to kick myself in the rear for buying shoes online without trying them on, and trusting Sketchers not to coast on their reputation.  $60....don't buy these!."

They are great for exercise walking and general wearing around, as they look more formal than sneakers. My only quibble, and the reason I didn't give 5 stars, was that everyone says these are washable - mine weren't too dirty but there was a small dirt stain near the toe of one, so I put them in the kitchen sink with Dawn and scrubbed them, and let them air dry. When they dried, the stain near the toe was gone, but now both shoes have nearly identical dark patches in two different areas (see photo) - anyone have any idea why?? Update: I used a toothbrush with a drop of Dawn to scrub around the stains, then used a hairdryer on low, and now they're fine."

It's kinda almost magical.  There is not a spot that even going sockless feels like there is any bad rub going on at all.  That being said, I ordered my normal shoe size and they feel slightly loose, like, 'stand on tippy toes and my heel come 80% out of the shoe' loose.  They kinda sound like flip flops when I walk. Not a deal breaker to me, but something to consider.  I don't know that they are even a half-size too large, just loose-fitting. Not sure they are terribly supportive, I probably wouldn't use them for any competitive walking, but after a couple days I don't think my feet are complaining yet. However, they do not have good ventilation, so my feet do start to feel a bit warm and the shoes and they are starting to smell a little ripe. An additional plus I found was the soles looked white on my monitor, but they are actually a light gray, which was pleasing, though I cannot explain why I feel this way.  It was a nice surprise, though."

I bought them for an upcoming trip to DisneyWorld after seeing Sketchers Go Walks recommended over and over as comfortable shoes to wear there. I think they probably would've been if not for 2 things: first, they are oddly loose in the heels. I also tried another style in this same kind of shoe and had the same problem. Second, they remind me of shoes my grandmothers would've worn. The grey color, the white sole, and the look of the top of the shoe just scream old lady shoe. I'm normally a size 8 and these seemed true to size except for the heel issue. I also liked that they could be thrown in the washing machine if needed. But overall, not a shoe for me."

I decided to order a half size larger to see if they fit better.  When I received these Go Walk 4's I was surprised to find that they are really large and fit more like a whole size larger than just the size 8 I ordered.  Hence I returned them and ordered a Go Walk 3 shoe in a size 8 to see how they fit.  So far they are acceptable but still do not feel they are true to size. I guess we just have to get used to the different sizing in clothes and shoes nowadays. Not what they used to be and not very dependable in sizing.  And I really like the Skechers brand. Wish their sizing was more accurate.

I have severe osteoarthritis in my feet and ankles, so I was desperate to find a well-cushioned, easy to put on shoe. I also wear a size 12, which is extremely difficult to find in a woman's shoe---especially shoes that are stylish. These shoes exceeded my expectations. They are super soft and provide a ton of well-cushioned support, which is great if you have issues like I do or you have to be on your feet a lot. They go on easily and are very comfortable. Not too tight, not too large. The fabric isn't scratchy at all and overall, the shoe is well made. I highly recommend these shoes.

The fabric feels very soft and snug around the foot. I have narrow feet in the 11-11W-12 size range and I have a bad knee, so finding shoes that not only fit but also have the cushioning and support I need can be a challenge. I bought these in a regular 11 black/white color and they fit well. They're slightly on the large end but not too much. For example, there's enough room that I can wear socks if I wanted but they don't slide off if I wear them barefoot, which is how I intend to wear them. I'll have to wear them more exclusively to see how they hold up, but I imagine I'll be buying a few more pairs in different colors soon enough."

I went down a couple sizes and added some padding. I have had several foot surgeries and I always look for comfortable shoes.  These are IT!!  Because the toe box of the shoes is somewhat wider , I could go down in size and still be extremely comfortable. For a ""normal"" fit these shoes would be heaven! The material is extremely comfortable and forms to your foot like a sock. The shoes grip your feet with just the right amount of hold.  They are probably a normal medium width. The material is just perfect for any foot type. The shoes are exceptionally light weight and perfect for travel. The cushy soles make it feel like your feet are walking on air. I think they are cute too!  I would love additional designs from Skechers in this material. A lace-up style would be perfect for me.  I totally recommend these shoes!  They may be the perfect shoe!"

I have another similar pair of Skechers and expected them to fit the same.  The difference is that the cut on top of the shoe (where the laces and tongue would be on a conventional sneaker) comes much higher on my foot than my other pair of Go Walks (that have been discontinued).  When I felt how high up it came on my foot I almost returned them as I envisioned pain across my high arch.  I gave them a chance though and walked around the house for the day.  They didn't hurt my feet at all!  There is a nice arch support and it's like walking on pillows.  I wear a size 7 (but my right foot is between a 6.5-7) and my foot is slightly wide.  These shoes fit perfectly as they give where they need to.  No rubbing, no blisters, no seams that irritate.  The back of the shoe doesn't rub my heal (a problem for me with other shoes).  I've been wearing them non-stop.  Also, I've had very good results with throwing my Go Walks in the washer from time to time (air dry) and they stay looking great."

They are not supportive at all, so if you want support I would not recommend these, but that is not what I want so I love them! My feet feel like they can move naturally in them with cushions that feels like clouds! They also seem to be made very well and I'm guessing they will last a while as long as I don't abuse them."

I have Cerebral Palsy and have a really hard time wearing any type of flats because I tend to ""walk out"" of the shoe, leaving the shoe behind.  They only brand that stay on are TOMS but they have no arch support at all. I bought these because I was looking for some arch support and a great, light walking shoe for travel and getting my daily 10,000 steps in. Tennis shoes make me fall down because they are clunky and I need a more form fitting shoe and do not get me started on shoe laces.  I think I found my shoe!  They stay on my foot because the top is higher up on my foot and there is plenty of cushion on the inside.  There is some arch support but I am really loving the heel support. It really does feel like I am walking around in my slippers all day.  They might be a bit snug when you first put them on but form to your foot after about a day of wear.  I wear a 7 1/2 to 8 and bought the 7 1/2 thinking I can return them for the 8 if needed but they fit great.  If you have a hard to fit foot - or feet that does not like shoes - give these a try.  I think you will like them too. Update:  I just ordered a second pair.  The right shoe is showing some wear but that is because I drag my feet and all of my shoes look like this fairly quickly.

These are the same as the original Super Socks ( ), except they have a slightly more padded insole with a waffle weave texture.  If I were to choose insoles, I'd prefer the original smooth insole; the waffle weave is ok but has a weird feel. I just love them.  The upper material is moderately soft and feels nice against the skin of my feet.  The soles are super cushioned.  The shoes are highly flexible and conform to the feet, indeed almost like wearing socks.  The arch support is minimal, just a slight hump; however, it's perfect for me.  These shoes are wider than most of the shoes I've tried on at a Skechers store.  I have a wide-ish foot; I can wear a B but prefer C.  These shoes do not rub or squeeze my feet at all.  Plenty of toebox room, too. I could easily wear these shoes all day and not really feel them.  I highly recommend. Since they fit so well on my foot, it's possible they don't fit a narrow foot as well.  Also, my older pair were touted as machine washable and I frequently wash them.  This new pair did not have an insert stating they're washable, but I've washed them a couple of times and they haven't fallen apart yet."

I love the Go Walk shoes across the board but the Go Walk Super Socks are my favorite by far.  They fit like a stretchy pair of slippers that are comfortably snug across the top of your feet so they move with you as your feet bend when you walk.  The soles are soft, supportive, have good traction, and give you a little spring to your step. They also launder well. It seems that if the Go Walk Super Socks have an overall softer feel than the other Go Walks and also since they have the antimicrobial lining, they are great to wear without socks. I have lupus and often have trouble with my feet and legs, so having the most comfortable shoes I can find makes a difference in my quality of life.  I cruise frequently and not only are these shoes super light to pack, but they have been awesome walking around ports all day.  I find that even when I wear Clarks or other good quality shoes, they are never as comfortable as the Go Walks."

I wanted something stylish and lightweight to pack for an extended trip.  These fit the bill perfectly.  I used them as dress shoes under pants, which was not perfect, but they also did not stick out as much as wearing full sneakers would have. The ridged bottoms are not overly obtrusive and so it does not look as if you are walking around in sneakers, even for those of us with large feet (I'm a 8 to 9).  I also used them for day to day site seeing.  They seemed to offer the same comfort as my athletic shoes in terms of extended walking around. They pack nicely and came back to their full shape easily even after being squished in an overly packed suitcase for almost 24 hours. However, these can't substitute for athletic shoes if you want to engage in fitness walking or running.  I tried both, and there is not enough support.  I did not think there would be, but it was worth a try. I liked these so much that I purchased two additional pairs on my trip in other colors."

I know my feet sometimes swell and hate when shoes become too tight and uncomfortable in the hot summer months.  The size 8.5 went back as they were too huge! (My feet won't swell THAT much lol.)  I kept the size 8 because they are plenty big enough with room to spare if my feet swell.  In fact, I may order a 7.5 because these do seem to run a bit too large.  I paid $35 which seems like a decent price. Same cushiony sole as my other Skechers and the walking comfort is what I expected but I've only worn them around the house a few times to make sure I liked them.  They'll get the real test this coming summer.  I'd like to order more in the other colors but the prices are all over the place!

Also read they stretched out somewhat and became more comfortable.  So when I tried them on and they were very tight across the top of my foot (along the ""tongue"" of the shoe, which looks like it sticks up in the picture, but it doesn't at all), I thought they would stretch out eventually.  They have ever so slightly, but I have worn them 20+ times and I still have a deep line all across the top of my foot, like a big ""C"" where the top of the shoe ends on the top of my foot.

I got the black and white in a size 8, which is the size shoe I normally like to wear (even though my foot measures as an exact size 7 1/2, I usually feel cramped in that size). I had a hard time deciding whether to go with a size 7 1/2 or an 8 due to some reviews stating you need to size down a 1/2 size, but I finally decided to go with my normal, comfortable size 8. The size 8 is very comfortable, although a tad bit loose at the heel when wearing them with no socks. I immediately took a 2 mile walk (with no socks) to see if that extra bit of room would bother me or rub and it did neither. I can wear a very thin sock with these shoes and they fit absolutely perfectly. I think a size 7 1/2 would not be as comfortable on my toes. They are easy to get on and off and feel so, so good. The foot bed is cushy and the pods on the bottom of the shoe make  for even more soft comfort. They really do feel like you are wearing a nice pair of slippers. And although there is no ""visible"" arch support in the sole of the shoe (like with my Birkenstocks or Vionics or Spencos), I get the support I need (maybe it's all those little cushion pods on the bottom?) and my feet do not hurt at all! I love wearing them at home on my hardwood floors. The only negative is that my feet do sweat a bit without socks, but I think that happens when you wear any closed shoe with no socks!

I have worn Keen sandals for years but I have a problem toe and the footbed on Keen's is hard and hurt my toe. After reading the reviews I decided an 8.5M rather than the wide size I usually get would work. I'm very glad I didn't order a wide size. I also sometimes order a size 9 but they would have been way too long if I had.  These were comfortable out of the box. I wore them all over Kauai when I wasn't wearing flip flops. They never hurt my toe and they were plenty wide enough. I don't like a lot of arch support so these are great for me, but if you do, you might not like these. Also my instep is very high and I was afraid they might pinch or rub but they did not. I'm so glad I got these before we went on vacation. If your foot is narrow you might find these sloppy."

I like this pair as well, which I just ordered, but the profile did change somewhat - the toe box of the shoe is very noticeably narrower, with the shoe narrow as well. I have fairly narrow feet, and the B width of this shoe is narrower than ideal. They loosened up after walking in them a bit - still slightly snugger, and so slightly warmer, than my previous pair, but a very good shoe even so. The newer version of this model - the Go Walk 3 Super Sock - has a different foot bed material, ""gogamat,"" which I found to be warmer and less comfortable than the foot bed in the Go Walk 2 Super Sock. Get the Go Walk 2 Super Sock while it still exists. You may receive it in a partial shoe box (the lid had been cut off for the pair I received), as though perhaps this pair had been a store display pair. I was not particularly bothered by that, but some people might be."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 2 Super Sock 2 Slip-On Walking Shoe,B00HSIBRJU,R3G3ZY2F0F1S4M,"December 29, 2014",2,"Shoes great initially, but beware...","Love the comfort of these shoes but there's a BIG problem.  The grippers on the bottom of the shoe wear down quite quickly, making the shoe dangerous in wet weather.  With no grippers (worn down to the sole), the shoes easily slide on pavement or other wet surfaces.  Be careful or you'll fall.  The bottoms wear out while the tops hold up beautifully.  Although comfortable, these shoes are dangerous.  See picture for example.  The shoes on left have only been worn about 5 times total and the bottom is already wearing away."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 2 Super Sock 2 Slip-On Walking Shoe,B00HSIBRJU,R1UPMAWOY9CLUU,"December 25, 2015",2,Poor life expectancy...,"I work twelve-hour shifts in a hospital as a secretary, and barely lasted fours months. I knew from observing the GoWalks of many of the nurses that I work with what to expect from the sole wear of these shoes. In our department, most of us leave our shoes at work for infection control purposes, so our wear is a good indicator of how our shoes hold up on our specific indoor conditions. It seemed that the tread on these would we worn flat after three months on average. Being that I am not on my feet near as much, I figured these would be acceptable for my needs. My go-to work shoe was always the Asics Kayano, but when it was time to get a new pair this year, I wanted something low maintenance to slip on with the ability to kick up at my desk. Basically, I wanted some professionally acceptable slippers/socks. While not the cutest, these fit the bill for lounging comfort. When walking around for extended periods, I didn't care for the support and structure, it felt like I was walking barefoot on linoleum, which isn't pleasant with high arches. They are also quite squeaky on this surface. I had concerns about wearing a fabric shoe, because I have severe in-toeing and always scuff up the toes of my shoes. From some user reviews I thought that I way wear holes quickly from stepping on my own toes, but that was not the case. The fabric uppers were quite nice, the perfect amount of stretch and a good coating to prevent absorbing ""splashes"" and staining. Into my fourth month of use they still looked very clean, but the wear of the soles are what now to I had been expecting and fairly flat. Tolerable. The deal breaker is that I have completely worn holes through the insoles. I always wear a thin ankle sock, and the friction from the sock under the front ball of my foot started as some pilling. I don't know if it is because of the smooth texture of the interior of this shoe, but the slightest lint or grain of sand working its way inside was always distracting, so feeling the wearing down was just downright uncomfortable. With one inch wide holes inside to expose the canvas between the layers of the shoe, they're now unwearable. I want to note that I am very petite, so I don't believe I physically put that great of a stress on the materials. If I had paid full retail, I would give have had to give one star. I was able to pick these up on sale, but even at that price and with realistically low expectations of wear, the life of these was disappointing. Obviously the investment into good running shoes is the better option for someone such as myself. I wear a true 7.5 in most athletic shoes, but like other Skechers I did have to go up to a size 8 for these."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 2 Super Sock 2 Slip-On Walking Shoe,B00HSIBRJU,R10GOW4EDAVVO5,"March 18, 2019",2,Possible fake Skechers,"I purchased these shoes less than two weeks ago.  They're my third pair of Skechers GoWalk 2 shoes so I know how they should feel.  With my previous pairs my feet would feel great for months until the sole would begin to wear down.  This pair has my feet hurting from the get-go.  They literally feel no different than the pair I was replacing.  These have ZERO arch support and I can practically feel the hard floor right through the sole.  Additionally, they make my feet stink, after only wearing them for 10 days.  Finally, the ""Skechers"" label on the inside of the sole has already peeled off--again, after only wearing the shoes for 10 days.  I am extremely disappointed and I doubt I'll buy any shoes through Amazon again since I don't feel like I can trust their sellers to be honest."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 2 Super Sock 2 Slip-On Walking Shoe,B00HSIBRJU,R1G9QSEBRJ3RE5,"August 19, 2015",5,Probably couldn't be better,"I wear an 8 in these shoes, when I usually wear a 7 1/2.  They really conform to the foot, don't slip and slide, provide good traction indoors and out, as well as reasonably good arch support.  Unlike some other shoes, the edges are a bit padded and therefore don't bind.  The shoes wash easily in cold water....but DON'T dry in a dryer, just air dry.  Best of all, they are easy to slip on...that hole at the heel makes it easy to pull them on without having the edge roll on your heel.  This feature is great for the handicapped and elderly who might otherwise have trouble putting on their shoes. I have five pair in different colors, believe it or not.  The prices vary wildly by color and vendor, but I have found that if amazon.com doesn't have your color one time, they might have it later, so it's worth waiting. I haven't washed mine many times yet, but I have one concern about the shoes.  One pair that I purchased through eBay (won't do it again) had a small defect that revealed a potential problem.  There is a decorative piece around the shoe right above the sole; it matches the shoe's color, but apparently is constructed from a white rubber cable-like material wrapped in a very, very thin piece of flexible plastic fabric of some sort, almost like a stretchy plastic wrap....that wrapping can be torn (the eBay pair already had a tear, and the material was so flimsy that I couldn't glue it).  However, none of the other pairs I have has had a problem, so I'm just prepared to watch for it and hope.  The shoes have too much going for them to worry about that small eventuality, I think."

Even better than that, they are comfortable. I have problem feet and cannot wear shoes with a narrow toe box. These have enough room without looking like clown shoes :) Luckily, I read other reviews about them running large and ordered 8.5 (I usually wear a 9) and they fit just right."

The forefoot is narrower than I expected, but still fit well. They're very cushy and comfortable. I don't think I would wear them for a full day of walking because of the narrow forefoot and the deep cushioning of the sole, but they were great for walking down the dock and were definitely non-slip on the sailboat."

Order your normal size. They are really comfortable and look really nice. I love the cushion in the inside and I can walk all day with out having any issues. The stitching that appears on the shoe does not irritate your feet on the inside like some shoes do.  Since it is only on the outside. I do recommend them. Glad I bought these."

I've had good luck with Skechers before, so I decided to try these. So far (after a few days) I am in love with them! I have a wide foot (like, no kidding wide), and these fit great - plenty wide! They are just a smidge too big (long), and I probably should have gone a 1/2 size down from my normal, but that is also without socks on -- they may fit just fine with socks on.

They are the most comfortable shoes ever. I have both types of insoles, memory foam and goga mat/max. There is never a break in period. They feel wonderful with the very first wearing. All of them, except for these. I had them on for only a few moments, and that's all I could stand. The memory foam insoles were so hard, it was painful. Sadly, I had to return them.

Skechers,Women's Go Step Lite-14730 Walking Shoe,B01N5PECGL,RLF8G4D9CIDN3,"February 25, 2018",5,Love Them!  More Colors Please!,I like the elastic ribbon type strap the other Go Step style has better than this velcro.  That is because once you set the velcro in place it is hard and does not stretch.  But the cushy inside of this shoe is better than the older Go Steps that are like canvas.  They all require me to add a 3/4 insole to give a better arch support.  I usually wear a 9B and with the insole I still wear a 9B in this shoe. I wish they came in more bright and pastel colors. I would buy them all because Skechers are all I wear anymore.  Life's too short to wear uncomfortable shoes!

I’ve worn them a bunch since I got them a few months back (even through water when I got caught in the rain!) and they’re holding up so nicely. The cushion is great on the insole.

Working in education, I'm on my feet a lot, and these soles are amazing for that. The only drawback is the seams are a little rough. I'm hoping with some wear that will ease up.

Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 4 A.D.C. All Day Comfort Walking Shoe,B01J2NZXQG,R1JUNYQ19MF8QJ,"April 21, 2017",4,Non adjustable laces,I am a huge fan of Sketchers however I didn't realize that these laces are just for decoration and do not actually adjust.  Have a high arch so getting the shoe on was difficult but when on it felt fine.  Just be aware - the laces are decoration only and that these are a slip/pull on shoe not a true tennis shoe.
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 4 A.D.C. All Day Comfort Walking Shoe,B01J2NZXQG,RT3GWIUVZF6RS,"February 21, 2018",5,Actually shaped for human feet!,"So I decided to go with a size 9.5 with these shoes as my experience these last few years has told me that shoes for women expect my toes to be a point and anything less than a 10 will be too tight in that area. Given the reviews noted they were somewhat large, I erred hopeful and went with a 9.5...which apparently was still too big. These shoes are shaped and sized for actual human feet. I can tell you that these shoes are not stupidly small like so many shoes made for women are, and that, to me, makes them a cut above pretty much every other shoe I've tried since...well, since I started picking out my own shoes as a kid. I've always had problem with the toe end of shoes to the point where I've just come to accept that my gym shoes will just have to have holes for my pinkie toes. Sandals are going to be ugly because cute ones expect me to have stick feet, flip flops are out because support doesn't exist, etc. These shoes are none of the above. The insides have a great amount of support, the shoe itself is wide enough and tall enough (for lack of a better description, when I say tall, I mean the space between the insole and the top of the shoe - this is another thing I've found many women's shoes make too small), and the toes. Oh the toes. They aren't too narrow. Given how I've just started defaulting to size 10 even though I know that's technically too large, I already knew it would be a bit big. But these size 10s are the biggest size 10s I've ever encountered. Normally my feet hold fine in a size 10 (as long as the shoes aren't super girly because those are just entirely out), but not with these. So I'm going to need to try and see if I'll be able to go down a half size, maybe even a whole size. For girls who've struggled to find shoes that fit because we live in a world where the shoe industry doesn't seem to understand that women have people feet too and deserve to have shoes shaped appropriately for them, these shoes are going to be great for you."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 4 A.D.C. All Day Comfort Walking Shoe,B01J2NZXQG,R101KZYNSJC4RI,"April 18, 2017",4,Had to return.,"I had them and returned them. That is not saying anything is wrong with the shoe. The very first Go Walks that came out in 2011/2012 were great for me, but every pair since I've had to get a wide. I contacted sketchers who confirmed these will not be available me in wide until June 2017, but I should go ahead and order these because they were so roomy. I didn't notice any extra room for this shoe as it was still a bit tight so I had to send them back. Once the wide come out I'll update my review. I just wanted to leave this to help others who are looking for wide and not sure if they should wait."

I would say there isn't much arch support, so standing for long periods of time might not be recommended in these, such as standing in long lines at amusement parks, but for normal standing and long walking, these are terrific! I had a pair of an older style of Go Walks that lasted forever, and mostly replaced them because these are cuter, lol. Once I started walking in Go Walks, I cast aside my much more expensive Adidas and Nike athletic shoes- these have those beat hands-down, as far as plain old walking goes. I wear a 9 normally and they fit as expected and were instantly comfortable, no breaking-in period."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Walk 4 A.D.C. All Day Comfort Walking Shoe,B01J2NZXQG,R3OKCMA93KGEPG,"February 12, 2017",5,Walking on clouds!,These are amazing. I started doing fitness walking after my knees hated running but I was doing it in my old running shoes. It always left my feet very sore. I ordered these hoping they'd make a difference and it's like walking on clouds. I've walked miles to the store in them. I had a string of 17k step days when I was moving house and these shoes kept me very comfortable. I ordered these a half size up because I didn't know you don't need to wear socks with them (they have antimicrobial stuff I don't understand and they are made to be worn sockless) But based on the fit I'll just order my regular size next time I order them. They still feel fine even though they are a half a size too big.

I run up and down flights of stairs chasing children around and hauling laundry.  As a stay at home Mom I need comfortable shoes at home and while out running errands.  These shoes are comfortable, and easy to slip into.  These things are easy to slip my feet into in the dark when my eight year old says ""Mom, I just puked all over the bathroom."" At 3 in the morning.  No need to fumble around in the dark, just slide my feet in and grab the paper towel and Lysol."

These are perfect and I wish I had ordered more!  These are the most comfortable and supportive shoes I have ever worn, and they look nice as well.  I love the built in no tie laces and they are light as a feather.  Because I have a sore big toe on one foot, there is NO pressure at all on that area so I didn't have to buy a wide shoe as I usually do."

All Day Comfort Walking Shoe,B01J2NZXQG,R1KZ8DLXWKAVP4,"October 24, 2017",3,"Great shoe, awful back piece","I bought the same size as other Sketchers, and these have not stretched, so they are true to size and seem to stay that way. The sole is very comfortable, and the material is almost too nice looking to wear walking dogs or doing yard work. The one thing I don't care for is the raised piece at the back, but apparently that's a ""feature"" of all the Go Walk shoes now. Whoever designed it - it's not an improvement. It rubs and I've had blisters from it. It's useless for pulling on the shoe, since it's tight to the foot (not like a loop you can pull), but does add a piece to rub on the ankle. I've had to make sure that I always wear socks that come up high enough to avoid soreness. My older pair of Go Walk do not have this, so it's something Sketchers have added. I love the comfort of the sole, but will probably look for something else if this is the current design"

They're relatively cute, the laces never come untied (because they're sewn on), they're easy to slip on, and with the least bit of effort, you can remove the included glued-in insole and put in your own inserts, if you'd like. However, the soles wear out way too fast relative to the price point. I purchased a pair on May 15, 2017. I used them only to walk to and from work on city sidewalks, just short of 10 miles per week. Less than two months later, the soles under the balls of my feet are so worn that I can feel every bump in the sidewalk. They're basically glorified socks at this point and will soon be unwearable. I previously had two pairs of GoWalk shoes (the original version), and both pairs lasted a year or longer before needing to be replaced. I would not recommend this style to anyone who actually wants to use them to walk outside on a regular basis."

One surprise, though -- the laces are not adjustable and are, in fact, GLUED to the top of the shoe at the bow.  Good for keeping them neat looking, as long as the fit is good and you don't need to adjust anything.  I wanted to change out the laces, though.  The cut of these is good for just slipping them on, and I like the Goga Max footbed the best of all the Skechers options. WAYYY smaller selection in wide shoes on Amazon, and most stores don't even bother to carry them now.  There's a wider choice than these, so these aren't terribly wide -- just widER, which is fine for me now. I've done the 1/2 size larger route for a while to have more style options, but with a small bunion, that's not ideal any more. So, these are nice.  But I wanted to color them up a little.  I cut the laces off and did it my way :-)"

I tried these on at a local shoe store, but these at Amazon were just slightly bigger.  What turned me off though, is the back part around the achilles.  Previously, I had a problem with my achilles due to a brand name sneaker, so now I am more aware.  I am having a hard time finding Skechers that does not rise high or inwards to the tendon.  While this shoe/brand works for many, it doesn't work for me.  I just mention this for anyone with the same condition."

These were a tiny bit too big, which normally would be fine because I can adjust the shoelaces. Unfortunately I did not realize these laces are for show, they do not function, they are stitched in place. Because they were a tiny bit too big I had to cut up strips of fabric and put them in the front of the shoe. Also, I am not sure what material is in the sole but wearing these when it's cold out was not a good idea, they made my feet colder. I wonder if there is gel, and that gets cold. They are cute, and have held up nicely so far aside from the size and lack of laces. They are cute and pretty comfortable too."

I had an intermational trip and needed to pack very light. These shoes weigh almost nothing. Then on the trip, we decided to do all kinds of hikes. Storms River and Table Mountain. Let me tell you about Table Mountain: 1km in elevation, scrambling up wet rocks, ladders, and steep and broken steps. I didn’t think these shoes could do it, but they were all I packed. Oh my goodness they held up. They did totally fine. Obviously not hiking boots, obviously not made for that purpose, but they held up and I made the climb. 10/10 would buy again."

I typically wear an 8 in all shoes with the exception of Skechers Go Walk brand.  The 8 was way too big but the 7.5 fit perfectly.  Super comfortable and easy on and off.  The (B) width fit my wide foot fine due to the nature of the upper fabric.  You can't really tell in the photos but the laces are not functional, they are instead a nice aesthetic detail."

I do not have a problem with this in any of my other shoes, boots or joggers. I can take these off, wash my feet and go wear my nikes for days with no smell related problem whilst I’m soaking my sketchers in antibacterial, antifungle sports rinse but, sure enough, I’ll pop these back on and after a week they’ll stink again. I’ll revert back to the Nike’s... no smell. Nothing. I’m not the only person that makes mention of this... funny enough I bought my mum the same shoes and she had the exact same issue. It’s very weird. I put up with it though (the continual sanitizing) because I LOVE these shoes. So comfortable. Great support and super spongy."

I am midway between normal width and wide, so it's always hard for me to find the perfect shoe. I didn't break these in before a 3 week European vacation, and I can't believe how great they've been (2 days left). No blisters, no pinching, no ankle biting; feels like I'm walking on air. I've received compliments on my stylish walking-for-miles-every-day shoes from my super trendy friend who now hates her ""mom sneakers"", (no offense - her words!!) At first I thought they might be too big, but they fit true to size with ankle socks. Love them!!!"

I am very sensitive to a high arch in tennis shoes because I am mostly flat footed, and was super hesitant at ordering online without trying on first, but took the advice that these were the best shoes for walking at Disney. They did not disappoint!! I did the unimaginable and received them the day before we left (I took my old shoes just in case); I walked no telling how many steps/miles at Disney for 3 full days and other than the normal tired feet, I had no pain and no complaints with these shoes!!!

Hoping it will come through as they did claim to accept the return."

I was concerned there was no time to break them in prior to the trip, but that was not an issue at all.  First day of the trip I wore them all day and they were fantastic.  Very comfortable and supportive; no pain in my feet or back at the end of the day.  They were a little snug and I don't think they will fit with heavy winter socks, which is the only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars.  Would be great if they came in wide widths, but I'm hoping they stretch out a little over time."
Skechers,Go Trail Escape Women Round Toe Suede Hiking Shoe,B01IFGIQ60,R2KV0CYQ2UPQ1Z,"January 4, 2019",5,Great for the trail,"These boots have exceeded my expectations.  First time I wore them, I hiked just over 2 miles.  The last hike wearing them was the stairs going to the bottom of Tallulah Gorge in Georgia.  Anyone that has walked this knows it is a strenuous hike.  The boots are lightweight and have great traction.  Best part about these boots is they are comfortable right out of the box.  No break in required."

I have a tendency to pronate and need a hiking boot to keep my ankles/feet from collapsing inward, but don't want something so heavy and clunky that it feels like Dutch klompen when I walk in it.  I had high expectations for these--hiking boots, AND from comfy Skechers!  Yay! But there is no padding or support around the foot, or in the tongue of the shoe.  It LOOKS like a hiking boot in the picture, but it is not.  It feels like a slip-on that has a high-rise upper stitched around it. Sorry, it had to go back."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Outdoor Walking Shoe,B01B2VSF4S,RXYAGA0L5E14T,"November 6, 2016",5,Attractive and versatile shoe,"When it comes to Skechers styles meant to be worn with socks, usually ordering a half size up is enough for me. In these, it wasn't, so I reordered in a full size up and those fit well (a little extra room but that's ok). I chose the black suede, which also has a black sole. I'm glad I hung in there and found these, because usually I end up with a more 'sneaker-ish' style for fall and winter, but these will be more versatile. There's not a lot of detailing, but they have a nice slick shape and quality materials that make up for it. UPDATE: I just wore them out on a day where I did a good amount of city walking, and they were great, although there is one tiny problem spot in certain foot positions. There is a lump at the point of the 'V' on the outside top, where the elastic is sewn to the suede. It was pronounced on the right foot of both sizes I tried, and even with the roomy larger pair I kept, the lump gets to the outside joint of my right foot at times, such as when using stairs. In the smaller size, that lump was miserable continuously. (It's odd that it was the right foot in particular that pushed me to the larger size, because in the past it's always been my left foot that needed the most room!) FYI, my feet may be just slightly wide, but I've always been able to wear medium width with no problem."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Outdoor Walking Shoe,B01B2VSF4S,R1QPE41WWGC71,"August 22, 2017",4,Required a Break-in Period,"I waited to post a review because when I first got these shoes, they were a bit on the tight side, and I couldn't wear them for more than a few hours without them becoming very uncomfortable. They are now broken-in and are quite comfortable, no longer pinching or putting pressure on the side of my foot as they did at first. I find them perfect for walking, and they're as good as my slides for ease of putting them on and taking them off. I'm glad I stuck with them through the break-in period, as I'm sure I'll wear them out now. They look nice with jeans and decent with slacks. Would not wear them with a skirt or dress - they're  a bit clunky. They do pick up dust and have to be brushed clean periodically - hardly unexpected with a suede finish."
Skechers,Performance Women's Go Outdoor Walking Shoe,B01B2VSF4S,R3GFMJLAI3532I,"March 20, 2017",5,Very good!  Recommend,"I bought a half size bigger due to the reviews and the cost was actually cheaper on the bigger size.  It fits comfortably, I don't notice it feeling too big at all, so my normal size probably would have felt tight.  I really like the way the shoes feel.  I wore them to an event where I was standing for many hours and I felt very comfortable.  Normally my feet hurt considerably after standing for any length of time, so this was an improvement.  I am sold on these Skechers styles.  They feel like I am wearing my house shoes around town but looks much better. I have to say though, I can not say how they wear.  I have only worn them once.  They did not rub on my heels or any where else so a big thumbs up!"

I usually wear a 9.5 shoe, but after reading reviews ordered a 10 as recommended. They do fit, but they're just a tad too snug around the toes. I can wear them all day, but I do notice a bit of pinching around my baby toes -  not enough to return them, but I would think about maybe trying another 1/2 size larger if I buy another pair."

The suede material is nice, and the shoes seem to be well constructed.  The bottom of the shoe has good traction like a hiking shoe.  I like them!"
